1692i

Recently, courts have held that debt collectors can escape 1692i's venue provisions entirely by pursuing debt collection through arbitration instead. As the NAF studies reflect, arbitration has not proven a satisfactory alternative. I urge the CFPB to include in a rule language interpreting 1692i as requiring debt collectors to proceed in court, not through largely-unregulated arbitral forums.

State and local court rules sometimes make default judgments much more likely. For example, when a person who allegedly owes a debt is told to come to court on a work day, they may be forced to choose between a default judgment and their job. I urge the CFPB to find practices that involve scheduling hearings at inconvenient times unfair, deceptive, and abusive, or inconsistent with 1692i.

There is currently a split between the Ninth and First Circuits as to whether 1692i and other FDCPA provisions apply in garnishment proceedings. In many states, the nominal defendant is the judgment debtor's employer, but the judgment debtor is the real party in interest. To allow consumers to better assert the defenses to and exemptions from garnishment available under state law, the CFPB should issue a rule applying 1692i to garnishment proceedings.




1692p

In many districts where bad check diversion programs exist, there is anecdotal evidence that the companies administering the programs threaten with prosecution individuals who do not come within the state's bad check law for example, checks that bounce due to printing errors, checks for which there were funds available when written but not when presented, and individuals who pay the amount due by other means within grace periods permitted by state law. The CFPB should ensure that bad check diversion programs have a realistic means of ensuring that only individuals realistically subject to prosecution are targeted, and should also require that, in order to qualify for the 1692p safe harbor, diversion programs prohibit misleading communications and misstatements of state bad check law.

Can there be a national repository to report abusive phone calls from debt collectors that masked (fake and "spoof") their caller ID? I got a brand new phone number a few years ago  and it obviously previously belonged to someone who is delinquent on their bills  because I get calls everyday from debt collectors looking for the person who had my phone number before me. No matter how many times I tell them they have the wrong number, they don't care and they just keep calling and they call from spoofed phone numbers. And this is my cell phone, which is against the law for debt collectors to call. The same debt collectors call with faked caller IDs. Here are just some of the phone numbers these debt collectors use: 808-792-8186 462643 858-568-7632 805-322-4584 706-913-1192 808-348-0083 858-345-4076 858-312-7724 908-505-9008 800-633-2677 252-808-7969 571-522-0386 407-712-3093 213-816-2972 804-721-3193 678-781-4530 427307 858-240-4079

ANYTOWN

My only concern about this excellent comment is that consumers not be subjected to a flood of confusing or potentially intimidating information. The most useful information is the what, when, who, and why of the original transaction that incurred the unpaid debt. The original creditor should be identified by a name known to the consumer, e.g. DR. JOHN SMITH, RHEUMATOLOGIST not DYNAMIC HEALTHCARE OF GREATER ANYTOWN d/b/a ASSOCIATED SPECIALISTS P.C. You get the idea.




BEOG

As a college grad since 1979 and a first-time homebuyer, I have found widespread violations of the FDCPA among the creditors and their outsourced private collections agencies. I've also found and been a victim of deception in the debt collection practice observing poor record keeping on the part of all parties. We must first examine debt collection from a derivative and forensic viewpoint; corporate finance, federally/state funded institutions and their debt obligations. GAAP allows for the write-off of old debts. Yet and still the creditors outsource collection agencies to collect debts the creditor has written off of their balance sheet. The debtor is always subject to the debt because the collection agency takes a percentage Then comes the finance charge (interest) and late payment charges. In essence, the original debt remains the same because the debtor is only paying commission, interest and late charges. I attended a Texas private college (state funded) that lost its accreditation for mismanagement of funds. My financial aid consisted of the BEOG, NDSL, Stafford Loan and the Merit Scholarship. The school policy was to clear the balance of my bill before my grades were released. Each grade period, whatever the balance was, my Mom used the funds she had left from our Social Security Income (father deceased 1972) after paying monthly expenses to send to me for my grades to be released. After my marriage, the Dept of Ed (Higher Ed) offset two years of joint tax returns, private collection agencies constantly called. When I was employed, I voluntarily paid $50/mo. for two years on this debt of which the principle was $4,650. Even after over 30 yrs., the debt was recorded as a Federal Abstract of Judgement at the county registrar (filed by private attorneys) as if I still owe the debt. I wasn't properly served. The process server (whomever it was) left a large manila envelope. Now the debt has been turned over to the Dept. of Justice in the State of Michigan. My point is that there is a widespread conflict of interest among the creditor and those outsourced by the creditor for debt collection. Most, if not all of these organizations are operated by taxpayer funding. The taxpayers are the ultimate creditors.




BillBartmann

The CFPB doesn't need to craft rules to encourage non-litigation alternatives or not to sell to those who utilize litigation models. BillBartmann's data is suspect as to 10M lawsuits filed yearly and likely his models comparing litigation and non litigation data has not been published. The facts are consumers need to reach out and communicate to a lender, agency, or debt buyer rather than not communicating at all. Debts not repaid usually result in the debt being charged off  so the consumer had a minimum of 180 days to seek alternative repayment options. Lenders, collection agencies and debt buyers have a right to sue a legal debt just like the IRS. Keep in mind that judgments last longer than open credit accounts looking at statute of limitations. To BillBatram's comment that filing bankruptcy creates hell as far as FICO scores, consumers face that issue with non payment of debt and bankruptcy is an alternative for a consumer to have a fresh start. That was the intent of the bankruptcy law and still is. Consumers with little or no hope to repay debts care more about moving forward with their lives instead of worrying about FICO SCORES.

Bonzarel

I agree with Bonzarel. The obvious solution is to ban debt collection calls to cell phones, period. Not everybody has the same options on their mobile plans,  and some have strict time/call/texting limits and/or restrictions.

Bonzarel. while I think your idea is a good one, it could open the floodgates to interest rate padding the debt until it reaches one of the "floors" that you are suggesting. 30% interest rate charges, penalties and fees (which in turn also get hit with a 30% interest rate charge), can accelerate even a 500 dollar debt into the thousands in less than 24 months time.




CRPB

Collection agencies should abide by the rules and regulations surrounding HIPPA (medical), Customer Proprietary Network Information (FCC) and other statutes already in place. While the CRPB cannot change those statutes,  agencies must still abide by it.

Collection Calls and Dunning notices (via letter or email) should include a unique Collection ID. This would be listed in credit reports for the purposes of tracking  and consumers would be able to enter into a online database provided by the CRPB with the type of violation or issue. This would also make it easier for the CRPB to look up disputes and determine if there's an actual issue.




CareGiving

After having a perfect payment history for 15 years, I had to across the board default on six accounts because I became an unpaid caregiver for my parents.However, before I ever defaulted, I contacted each account and explained what was going on.I would also like to note that five of the six accounts were still being paid down until I ran out of savings.I discovered the credit card companies HAVE NO INTAKE for potential defaulters.I consider a potential default division a cost of doing business that credit card companies have eschewed because they have co-opted the courts to do all the work for them for a very nominal fee.My goal was simple, keep making monthly miniscule autopay payments on all six accounts in exchange for no harrassing phone calls so that I could concentrate on CareGiving AND modifying my self employment so that I could make something every month.Everyone refused, and the harrassing and MORE IMPORTANTLY REPETITIVE phone calls started.I ended up having to convert my land lines to 6 dollar a month cell phones, and then I rarely used them because I could not afford the 20 cents a minute cost.In essence the credit card companies and debt collectors destroyed the best way I had to regenerate earnings while still being an unpaid CareGiver.And as Marlene so eloquently pointed out, an additional roadblock is the debt collectors ABSOLUTE REFUSAL to put any verbal agreement reached in writing!

I found an unsealed envelope in my mail box that had court documents in them. I contacted the debt collection company and asked what was going on  since I had not been served. They claimed a subservice had already been done to someone at my residence. I explained that was probably not likely  because I am a Caregiver and I would have been the only one to answer the door and I did not get any service. I had to pay to file a response and was late by one day, andthen had to challenge the default because of the non service. The judge agreed that there had been no valid subservice  based on the fact that the service company used the most generic "guess" they could come up with, a women in her mid 30's to late 40's, around 5 foot 4 inches, weight around 130 pounds to 150 pounds. That is about as generic of a description as one could give,  and it was completely wrong. because that person did not exist. They even made up a name of someone I had never heard of and when I googled the name, could not find it anywhere on the internet. The second time a false subservice happened, a very similar description was given as the first time,  and the alleged subservice recipient was identified as "Jane Doe". I would like to point how dangerous these lies are on another level. I exclusively have been providing CareGiving services for my parents, no one else has. By lying and introducing these lies into a court document, anytime in the future I could be accused of exposing my parents to a person at our residence who never even existed. I was also somewhat frozen by this level of dishonesty because on the rare occasion when I had to sue someone, I followed the law and had the service performed legally and properly. I just expected the same in return and by not getting it weakens one's ability to respond.




DEFAULTERS

I also find the assertion that INVOLUNTARY DEFAULTERS don't put up a legal defense because they are afraid or have a lack of knowledge about the legal system to be outrageous. Strategic Defaulters save part of the money that could have gone to pay down their debts so they can give it to an attorney who may be able to get them a sweet pay off deal. INVOLUNTARY DEFAULTERS keep trying to make their monthly payments until the monthly accrual of interest rate charges and/or a life changing event forces then into an INVOLUNTARY DEFAULT. INVOLUNTARY DEFAULTS are not recognized by the courts. I had a SPOTLESS payment record for 15 years prior to a life changing event that caused me to become an unpaid CareGiver. If I could have been allowed to start with very small monthly payments to all of my creditors in exchange for having my phone lines left alone, I probably could have started making some income again. Instead, the constant debt collection phone calls forced me to convert my land lines to 20 cent a minute cell phones that I could not even afford to answer. I LOST work and contacts because debt collectors would not accept small monthly payments as a beginning pathway towards paying off my alleged debt. Probably the ongoing interest rate charges on default debt makes it unrealistic for debt collectors to accept small payments. Until alleged defaults are truly frozen so that those who want to pay them off have the best chance to do so, more and more debt will accrue.

Compliance 2013 demonstrates the type of arrogance that I have been addressing in my prior comments. The belief that a default is a default by courts along with the practice of REWARDING Strategic Defaulters while sentencing INVOLUNTARY DEFAULTERS to never ending escalating debt because of the ongoing interest rate charges needs to be addressed. I have been researching consumer debt for the past few years  and Consumer Debt is ON THE RISE GLOBALLY, and that is not a good thing. Canadian finance expert warns about rising consumer debt. __URL__ I can replace Canada in the title with England, Australia, South Africa, China, Russia, Ireland and on and on and on. The consumer debt escalation is being caused by a ridiculously low 2% monthly minimum payment, the gateway drug to higher and higher debt, and because consumers who have legitimate life Changing events that cause them to default cannot plead INVOLUNTARY DEFAULT in court. We let criminals plead involuntary to many crimes, but not law abiding citizens when it comes to their credit cards and student loans!




DONOTCALL

I had surgery at a hospital in 2006. I have 2 forms of insurance, both excellent. Therefore I rarely have a medical bill to pay, or it is for a very small amount. Sometime after the surgery (I do not recall how long after the procedure), there were repeated calls to my phone by an actual person who said, " This is (first name), give me a call at (phone number)". Since we did not know the person, no one called back. We thought we should report it to the DONOTCALL list, but we had no company name to report. Finally I happened to answer the phone when that number appeared and the male voice said, "you know what this is about, right?" and I said, "no". He said, " you have an overdue charge with (hospital name). You haven't paid your bill. I work with a bill collection company". I said "I have never received a bill." He said "really?" I said , "yes" He said, "Call accounting at the hospital". I called the hospital and they said to talk to my insurance company. I called my 2nd insurance company and they said both the first and the second insurance company had paid the hospital. The 2nd insurance company said I did owe money on the bill, something like $1.08. A bill collection company had been hired to collect $1.08 for which I had never received a bill! I asked both insurance companies to send me additional copies of the Explanation of Benefits. When I received the copies, I sent them to the billing department of the hospital with a check for the amount that the 2nd insurance company said I owed. I never did receive a bill. Nor was i warned it might go to a collection agency. A collection agency was hired for an amount just slightly over $1.00. Because of this experience, I do not plan ever to use this hospital again if I can help it. My family has had referrals to doctors associated with this hospital, but I always try to get a doctor who is not associated with it.




Disputability

If you want to instantly level the playing field, make any credit card debt above and beyond the moment of default, disputable. Disputability of any amount over the amount at the moment of default would instantly get both the credit card companies and the debt collectors working with the consumer on a reasonable plan going forward, no? As it stands now, credit card companies can and usually do jump the interest rate up to as high as 29.9% and may even let the account stay in default  as they rack up frequent default points on the debtor. When I gave up my regional emmy award winning video business to become a caregiver for both of my parents, eventually savings ran out and I notified each of my credit card vendors ahead of any default. NONE could offer me anything other than, "pay your bill on time". If instead the credit card companies know that once the default occurs they cannot accrue any more penalties, fees or interest rate charges on the debt, they will bend over backwards to work with the alleged defaulter to get them to pay down the debt. Citibank rate jacked my never late payment 15 year old credit card account by 5,000 dollars. I dispute that amount of excess in lieu of why I had to default, but Citibank does not care, nor does the debt collector. The amount of the debt reverted to what it was at the time of the default, you can bet citibank would be working hard to work with me.




IARDC

First, I have learned there is a significant legal difference between 1) identify theft, 2) mistaken identity (see contract law Furthermore, that these three words need to be separated, clarified and their legal handling completely examined. There is almost zero legal remedy for wrong person found. More information would NOT have helped. The lawyer had plenty information  but he did not validate any of it after he found my address. The clerk told me these lawyers and their agents are "just going through the phone book/internet" hauling people with the same first and last name into court thinking they will eventually find the debtor. A complete waste of court resources, an enormous expense to the innocent citizen, and the unlawful detainment and threatening of an innocent citizen and their assets. The debtor, it has since been discovered has left the county. The lawyer could have easily validated his information using online public property records from both the Clerk of courts and the County Clerk and found out the middle initial was not a match along with over 7 other pieces of identifying information that were not a match. The lawyer did not even do the simplest checking. I filed with the IARDC  and nothing happened.




INVOLUNTARILY

I disagree with the above assessment. As an alleged defaulter I have asked over and over and over again to have the debt set where it was at the time of alleged default and that no more penalties fees or interest rate charges be tacked on, and that I will commit to a monthly autopay. People who INVOLUNTARILY defaulted because of a life changing event in their lives (such as becoming caregivers for their parents) may want to consider all of their defaults together, so if five defaults occurred, the alleged defaulter has to divide whatever money they may be able to apportion every month, by five. Debt collectors refuse to see this as a reasonable solution and only acknowledge their own debt with the alleged defaulter, making it impossible for the alleged defaulter to do the right thing and begin paying back everybody.

I would suggest that debtors who INVOLUNTARILY defaulted on a debt don't have the money to hire an attorney, so they don't see the point to going to court without an attorney. Why doesn't the court give access to free legal counsel to debt defaulters the way they do to those who are accused of committing a crime?




InsideArm

This Draft Summary of Discussion fails to address the issues of confusion about the statute of limitations and how they vary among states. This is a big source of confusion in terms of collection of a debt and jurisdiction. Creating a more stanadrized set of rules would alleviate these problems. In 2010, the FTC released a report, "Repairing A Broken System," which made mention of the need a universal statute of limitations. Additionally, in 2011 ACA's plan, "The Path Forward: ACA International"s Blueprint for Modernizing America"s Consumer Debt Collection System" also advocated for a national statute of limitations. This is something that both sides of the industry actually agree upon. 50 different states and 50 different statutes make it too confusing for consumers. I also reiterate that a compromise in terms of years can be reached. Also, debt tolling needs to be done away with. It only adds to the confusion of when a debt becomes time-barred. We live in a transient society. A debt should not legally follow a person for the rest of their life: Repairing A Broken System - Federal Trade Commission: __URL__ InsideArm: Statutes of Limitations Frustrate Debt Collectors and Consumers __URL__ The Path Forward: ACA International"s Blueprint for Modernizing America"s Consumer Debt Collection System: __URL__




JClark53

The burden of proof cannot be placed anywhere else, JClark53. But, a disputed account is rare. Most people are aware of their obligations, but just cannot pay them now. Starting the process should be simple and clear to each party, not talk about judgments or disputes where it is unlikely that either apply.




Jeffreyjon

Jeffreyjon, it sounds like you are identifying how a strategic defaulter acts. However, Involuntary Defaulters don't have the income available to pay down a debt if the interest rate charges are going to keep accruing.




Juddgement

As a Director for Collections now for Kennedy Space Center Federal Credit Union, which is over 500 Million in asset size I try as I have for prior union to file suit closest to the Consumers current address. One method is to assign over to an attorney within the current residence-venue of the Consumer. In legal terms we attempt to get service when filing a suit out of state, its method is called obtaining if possible a Alien Juddgement outside from the County and or State the contract/note was originally signed. There are states in the Union that do note accept foreighn judgments. So recording a judgement obtained for example in Floirda and rerecorded in another State may not be possible.




Longblack

I'm concerned that the proposed rules are just a back door to allow Director Cordray to find out about my special toy collection. He has sent me writings demanding my special toy collection, and I'm afraid that now that he's Director of the CFPB, he's using his power to come after my favorite toy, Mr. Longblack.




MLegz13

A lot of excellent points made by MLegz13. My elderly parents needed help with day to day activities even if they were too proud to say anything. I stopped my award winning video business to be their CareGiver. Once the savings ran out, I had to default after 15 years of having a perfect credit card payment history. The debt collectors were constantly accusing me of being a "refuse to pay" even though I said I acknowledge the debt but had no income at the moment. It is this type of scenario that requires debts be frozen where they were at the time of default and in exchange the debtor agrees to pay off the debt, even if the initial monthly payments are just for a couple of dollars. What this does is free the debtor's phone lines so they can completely focus on moving forward rather than engage in pointless rat a tat with repetitive debt collection callers. It's why I started the Debt Neutrality Petition as well. If you click on the link PLEASE read the comments left by some of the 500 plus people who have signed the petition. Even a debt collector signed the petition, their comment speaks volumes of truth, as did all the others as well. Debt Neutrality Petition. __URL__




Mslade

Mslade, you have some valid points about the confusing Foti rulings, but I think you are wrong about the TCPA. This law has always applied to debt collectors, politicians, and even charities with respect to cellular phones. And it's not just one judge who has ruled in this way. The FCC and the courts have repeatedly affirmed it.




NEWYEARS

I agree with anoymousme, I am constantly called up to 5 times a day by numerous collectors for my kids bills. Why should we have to bothered. I gave my kids the message  but they ignore it. They do not have a land line  so they call me!!!On NEWYEARS  I am dropping my land line which I have had for 40 years just to be rid of these pests! How long are parents responsible for deadbeat children.




RBell

Agree with RBell. Delinquent borrowers already almost always know they're delinquent so further notices are not productive. When notices are provided they should include the name of the original account holder and the full account number to establish a connection between any tier debt collector and the original account holder.

You are not living in the real world if you think it is just so easy, RBell. No, most consumers are not lawyers. The people using these debt collection practices are deliberately abusing the law  because they know most who are harassed and in debt and working people who probably can't afford a lawyer. And I'll just bet it is worst in the states with the least amount of consumer protection. Take care. You will sing a different tune when it is you on the meat hook.




RHEUMATOLOGIST

My only concern about this excellent comment is that consumers not be subjected to a flood of confusing or potentially intimidating information. The most useful information is the what, when, who, and why of the original transaction that incurred the unpaid debt. The original creditor should be identified by a name known to the consumer, e.g. DR. JOHN SMITH, RHEUMATOLOGIST not DYNAMIC HEALTHCARE OF GREATER ANYTOWN d/b/a ASSOCIATED SPECIALISTS P.C. You get the idea.




SUBSERVE

Please go hard after the service industry. They have done a lot to foul up the debt collection process by having their service people FALSE SERVE and FALSE SUBSERVE prospective debt collection alleged defaulters. It's happened to me twice,  the first time the process server simply guessed by using the most generic age size, weight and assign a made up name! The second time the servicer simply called the sub server "Jane Doe" and once again made up the most generic cut across as many age, height and race descriptions they could come up with, which meant they could not be more far off. Then when I went to court I just happened to hear another defendant make the claim to the judge that they were never served, that the paper work was left outside the door. Besides the service company lying in court documents about serving someone that was not actually served,  which in and of itself should be enough to give the judge some type of latitude to do something to protect the defendants,  when a debt collector knows they can get a false service, they have MUCH LESS MOTIVATION to negotiate with the defendant.  Judges don't seem to get this aspect of false service. I know what I know  and I will state unequivocally anywhere that I have twice been false served/subserved.




TRuly

Clear communication helps everyone, not just consumers. I think debt collectors when trying to collect just send bills, and everyone knows what a bill is. But when they devolve into harassment, they blur the lines between trying to collect debt within the law and behaving in misleading and abusive ways toward consumers. TRuly, the robot calling, the letters, they have money enough for this. If they communicated clearly up front, they would save more money. The post office is still a good deal, not an expensive way to communicate. You are missing the boat on the problem, though. It is not the costs or whether they should communicate. Most of these companies hire people who are barely literate, poorly trained and certainly uninformed -- wait, UNINFORMED -- about the laws that already exist regarding debt collection. That is a huge problem when trying to get information from an employee who doesn't know the law requires him/her to provide certain information. This has come about from decades of lack of oversight, in my opinion. Lack of oversight, lack of clear rules and lack of enforcement. So, if they don't have to worry about following the law, they hire whoever they can cheap and don't bother to train them. This is why there are so many of these companies and after some of them do get in trouble, they just change their name and keep on doing the same law-breaking habits.




Tfleeman

The national database and licensing would be a good idea if it were used effectively to weed out the bad collectors and put them (and their corporate officers) out of business permanently. Not those who get caught up in technical violations over mini-Mirandas, but the ones who knowingly commit serious violations of the FDCPA, FCRA, and TCPA. As Tfleeman noted in his very insightful comment above, the "private policing" we have now has not been effective in stopping the worst abuses. As for the main topic of this page, I think it's far better for a collector to leave a voicemail (with clear identification of the caller and callee) than to call the same number 50 times without leaving a message. The rules should encourage this rather than frustrate it. So, I would favor option #1, with the mini-Miranda deferred until the collector is sure he is talking to the right person.




agnency

It has been my experience that practices can vary greatly between various creditors who find it necessary to turn delinquent or defaulted debt over to a collection agnency. In my situation, little or no notification was given. At a minimum, a creditor should give specific information as to date and which company the debt is being assigned or sold to. Getting such a notice would help me understand that there is going to be a change with whom I would be communicating with going forward. The costs and expenses or problems that dad honors are collectors would have been giving those is miniscule compared to the problems cause by not giving notice. I would argue that they would actually save money in the long run like giving such notices. At a minimum, The information that should be clear that in the notice is (1) the date of when the debt would be turned over to collection agency; (2) the name address of the collection constant company to whom the doubt was assigned; and (3) specific formation about the debt collection company and a list of that company's "best practices", policies and procedures as to what the consumer can expect. It would be good if there could be a single-point-of-contact for this company as well as the supervisors and owner of the collection company. Collection agencies need to be forced to deal more forthrightly with consumers and be required to deal with greater transparency.




alegal

It apprears that the debt collectors of the debt collection industry are conducting a money laundry and racketing operation by explointing and obtaining monetary from comsumers for products that they don't sell to them or services that they don't provide to consumers with no inital purchase contract with consumers. It appears that debt collectors are obtaining monetary from consumers where they don't have licenses to sell products to consumers or provide services to consumers. It appears that debt collectors are costing companies money when companies are trying to recover their loses when they miss payments from their customers for the products that they sell to their customers or the services that they provide to their customers with alegal purchase contracts. It seems that debt collector are relying on companies' money and on consumers' money for an income when they are not initially involved in the a company sale of products to consumers or in the distributing of a company of services to a consumers.




anoymousme

I agree with anoymousme, I am constantly called up to 5 times a day by numerous collectors for my kids bills. Why should we have to bothered. I gave my kids the message  but they ignore it. They do not have a land line  so they call me!!!On NEWYEARS  I am dropping my land line which I have had for 40 years just to be rid of these pests!

autodialed

Collectors are responsible for re-establishing contact with delinquent customers and providing services that facilitate repayment of the loans, regardless of the technology utilized. In Collections, automated dialing systems effectively increase the ability for the collector to reach delinquent customers unwilling to proactively reach out to the creditors. Automated dialing systems are used in many other ways not related to debt collection: telemarketers use them to reach potential customers, schools use them to notify parents of closings due to inclement weather. The technology is the same but the intent is different based on the user. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) prohibits creditors from using automated dialing systems to call cell phone numbers without consent from the customer. The TCPA"s original purpose, protecting consumers from costly charges as a result of automated calls, has been subsumed by the new goal of preventing overly numerous call attempts to a number that (generally) is directly connected to the customer. It does not change the purpose of collection calls,  it merely makes the process less efficient. Regulating which numbers can be called using an automated dialing system is also counter to the growing reality of wireless-only households. According to the Center for Disease Control's 'Wireless Substitution' latest report (Early release data, July-December 2012), over one third (36%) of adults in the United States live in a household with only wireless telephone service. That figure is even higher (45%) when you look at children living in the US. With an average annualized growth rate of 34%, it is conceivable that sometime before 2020 only a minority of the country's adults will be living in households with a landline telephone that can be autodialed. The CFPB should allow for the autodialing of all telephone numbers provided by the customer without byzantine consent requirements. Regardless of whether it is at application or during the course of normal business, once the number is provided by the customer to the creditor, that number should be considered another viable option for collection.




calller

Agreed. And it should be their real phone number. So that when you miss their phone call and try to call them back, it should go to the real company. And not say something like "the call can not be completed as dialed." I mean, what is the point in that. Some debtors can't get to their phone before it goes to the answering machine  and if the collectors don't leave a message, the debtor will try to call back. But then the call can't be completed when you try to call back. So, really what was the point of the call. Many debtors would just assume it was a scam call. Increasing Right Party Contacts should be the goal. And that goal can only be reached if the real phone number is showing up on calller id.




colleft

That is insane. My mom heard one when I was playing my voice messages at home. They should only disclose through texts. Texts arent something that will be heard by others. That long message saying they are collectors and trying to colleft a debt is ridiculous!!




communicationand

Notification that a debt is being sold would be ideal as it would afford the debtor the opportunity to negotiate the amount and possibly assist in thwarting any potential negative reporting on one's credit report.If a debtor is afforded the opportunity to negotiate his or her debt for a reasonable amount, perhaps the selling and reselling of debt may be marginalized.More and more consumers have emails and other modes of communicationand therefore, it would be in the best interest of all parties to amicably resolve issues.However, should the dispute not be quelled, reasonable arrangements should be afforded to the debtor.Debts as assets is an outrageous concept and it behooves both the debtor and the creditor to "work-it-out".That is in the best interest of all.It begins with information, communication and resolution.




conusmer

Additionally, collectors should not be allow, under ANY circumstance, to use any method which would cost the conusmer money. For example, cellphones and texting should be banned completely from calls from collectors.




coopertaed

I have never been deliquent on my State taxes. Due to an error made by the company I worked for in 2008, which didn't take out taxes, I am now faced with dealing with the State Collection agency. I have never heard of the State threating the residents to try to collect taxes. I called and coopertaed, however, the callers are harassing me from morning to night. I have excellent credit and have worked for many years to maintain my credit standing. I have never owed Federal taxes that I have not agreed to pay. And never in my life owed State taxes and I am shocked that they can hound the residents like private collectors do. I am retired and and on a fixed income. For the State to be able to threaten the residents who are making attempts to pay the taxes, (one year) seems like a violation of rights.




countybut

I was flat out lied to by the attorney for a credit card company who brought a small claims suit against me. I disputed the debt (and still do even after they garnished my wagesbut they intimidated me into a payment arrangement then lied to me and said there was no court date anymore since I "settled".I was skeptical and called the clerk of court's office only to find out they liedand I did need to show up.I showed up for the court date, even as I argued that this court had no jurisdiction over me because I never lived in that countybut no-one even the clerk's office would listen to meand I was denied the right to go before a judge.I was only given an opportunity to talk to the attorney for the credit card company and sign papers saying we had a payment arrangement.Long story short, I made 1 of 2 payments then lost my job.I called them immediately to tell them I would make the 2nd and final payment 2-3 weeks late because I had to wait for a final check.They told me okay,but unbeknownst to me,they went back to court without me and got a default judgement for $1600 on what would have been a $709 payment.iI never got notice of the court hearing nor did I ever get a copy of the judgement.I didn't find out about it until I got a wage garnishment notice from my new employer 2 1/2 years later....VERY humiliating!My employer got the wage garnishment notice a week before I didso I couldn't even dispute it before my employer was involved.Second, I called the clerk of court's office in that county (3 hours from my home) and argued that you can't go to court without giving me a chance to defend myself and I shouldn't be forced to drive 3 hours each way to a county I never lived in.I was told by the clerk's office that they can file it wherever they want and I have to show up.I asked "So if they wanted to file this in California to be jerks you're telling me I'd have to get on a plane and fly to California to defend a $709 lawsuit""She said "Yes."THAT HAS TO CHANGE.




crediters

What I mean is I have had my credit report cleared three times they were never on either of them. And when i think I have cleared all of my crediters they get a judgement and freeze my account.




damanages

Given the highly coercive consequences of having negative information reported to or by CRAs on consumer credit reports, I think it is reasonable that a debt not be deemed "verified" or "substantiated" unless and until there's a final non-appealable order, but only in circumstances where the consumer has timely disputed the existence or the amount of the debt. Currently, if you dispute a debt, the debt collector reports you to the CRAs  and your credit standing is adversely impacted; i.e., the damage is already done at that point. In other words, the notation on the credit report that the debt is disputed by the consumer is largely ignored by potential lenders, employers, landlords, etc. Thus, disputing the debt does nothing to prevent harm to the consumer. The debt collector and creditor threaten to report you to the CRAs as a coercive tactic to force you to pay a debt even though you might legitimately not owe the debt or the amount claimed to be owed. As for my proposal, I do not think this will lead to more litigation. Just the opposite. If a consumer doesn't timely dispute the debt, then the debt can be deemed verified or substantiated. If, however, the debt is timely disputed, creditors and debt collectors will have to evaluate whether to initiate litigation and weigh the likelihood of prevailing at trial  and this may cause creditors and debt collectors to be more judicious about which debts to take to trial. This proposal would also protect consumers from having their credit standing negatively impacted until after it is conclusively determined that a purported debt that is disputed is in fact owed and the amount of such debt is conclusively determined. As an alternative to my initial proposal, a rule could be adopted that would impose significant statutory penalties, treble damanages and recovery of attorney's fees against creditors, debt collectors and CRAs in the event the consumer can prove either the disputed debt doesn't exist or the amount of the debt is less than that claimed to be owed. This approach, however, places the burden of proof on the consumer and I feel strongly that the burden of proof should be on the creditors and debt collectors to affirmatively prove the existence and amount of any disputed debt before a consumer's credit report is adversely impacted.




didso

dispue

It seems to me that the system must provide a series of 'handshakes': When a dispute is initiated; when the dispue is resolved; or when a dispute is withdrawn. In each case the consumer must know with certainty that the collector acknowledges the consumer's position and that the CRA has been properly notified. The CRA must be party to the handshake, It is unacceptable that consumer's complaints can laguish for months with the consumer having no way to determine whether the CRA has received updated information from the collector or whether the CRA is taking unduly long to process the update.




disregaring

I have a hard time believing that a debt collection company "treat[s] EVERY dispute the same" when debt collectors seem to blatantly disregard a dispute that has the appearance of being "copied directly from the internet." Consumer advocates are trying to educate consumers, debtors, and alleged debtors with information on how to handle debt collectors or how to handle their particular situation. We are try to give them relevant links to FDCPA, FCRA, HIPPA, and various form letters that can help them communicate with debt collectors. There is nothing wrong with form letters. But there is everything wrong with debt collectors disregaring certain letters just because they don't like that it came from a consumer advocate source. Debt collectors operating legally and with nothing to hide should never treat form letters as something to throw in the trash. You seem to be saying that debt collectors will only want to communicate with consumers who are misinformed and don't know what their rights are, rather than communicate with a consumer who knows the laws and the appropriate ways to address a letter of dispute.




drose977

I strongly endore drose977's response. Currently, debt collection agencies can sell debt without proper validation. Or they can sell the debt if a consumer disputes the debt and the agency can't product the proper validation. These things should not be allowed and are very detrimental to the consumer. Consumers should be protected above collectors and other agencies as they, typically, have far less resources to fight inaccurate information. Additionally, the inaccurate information adversely effects consumers more than any other group in these situations. Collectors should not be allowed to report a debt as 30 days late if the debt isn't 30 days late. The law should include stiff enforcable penalities to deter collectors from pre-dating debt. These rules should apply for any debt reported late at any time, not just the first 30 days.




ebtor

When alleged debtors are served with state court summonses, they are not always comprehensible to laypersons. Any requirements to file papers to avoid default judgment The date of any scheduled hearing and procedures for changing the date Local and online sources of information for pro se defendants, and possibly local non-profit advice organizations. That the debtor may wish to consider bankruptcy if they cannot pay their debts.

There is currently a split between the Ninth and First Circuits as to whether 1692i and other FDCPA provisions apply in garnishment proceedings. In many states, the nominal defendant is the judgment debtor's employer, but the judgment debtor is the real party in interest. To allow consumers to better assert the defenses to and exemptions from garnishment available under state law, the CFPB should issue a rule applying 1692i to garnishment proceedings.

When an attorney is a 'Debt Collector' (as per their own documents) and not legally considered a 'Collection Agency' the attorney is not held accountable for consumer protection law violations (both local and federal) within civil court. This loop hole needs to be addressed. The attorneys/debt collectors are not monitored by the state bar because it is a collection practice  (the attorneys buy old debt and then collect upon that debt in civil court and the state and federal civil courts are not monitoring the attorneys because it is an attorneys office and not considered a collection agency  - even though the attorneys buy old debt then take alleged debtors to civil court. I personally know of a very large attorney agency in Washington State that even gives classes thru the Washington state bar to other attorneys because it is a easy caseload to win.

The original creditor has information about the debtor's language; ii) The collector obtains information about the debtor's language; *or* iii) The debtor lives in a ZIP code known to have a significant (5%?) number of non-English speakers. This requirement should only apply to languages with large LEP populations - a threshold might be 100,000 - to avoid undue cost. For smaller populations, where obtaining a full translation might be uneconomical, collectors could include the following passage translated into the appropriate languages on an otherwise English letter:

Allow the States and/or local courts administer lawsuits. Regardless of any added rules, documents, etc. none will help increase debtors attending hearings. Since 1964 I have seen no significant increase of consumers attending hearings. I have, however, seen the major reason being attributed to not understanding due process by consumers.

Assuming debtors have a valid address, which is some cases they do not, additional notice that the debt is being assigned to a third party collection entity is no benefit.My experience is intervention to collect by a third party normally occurs when the consumer is over 180 contractual delinquent.Furthermore, if the consumer receives the warning the account would be placed with a third partyMany and more confusing to the consumer and agency.

FDCPA should define what constitutes reasonable period of time. In my experience most attorneys who represent a debtor do not return communication inquiries about representation. In most cases the delay in response may be caused by the debtor paying installment payments to the attorney to file a bankruptcy proceeding. When the debtor does not keep the repayment terms a creditor is presently not notified that the representation has terminated  and there is no attorney representation.

First, I have learned there is a significant legal difference between 1) identify theft, 2) mistaken identity (see contract law Furthermore, that these three words need to be separated, clarified and their legal handling completely examined. There is almost zero legal remedy for wrong person found. More information would NOT have helped. The lawyer had plenty information  but he did not validate any of it after he found my address. The clerk told me these lawyers and their agents are "just going through the phone book/internet" hauling people with the same first and last name into court thinking they will eventually find the debtor. A complete waste of court resources, an enormous expense to the innocent citizen, and the unlawful detainment and threatening of an innocent citizen and their assets. The debtor, it has since been discovered has left the county. The lawyer could have easily validated his information using online public property records from both the Clerk of courts and the County Clerk and found out the middle initial was not a match along with over 7 other pieces of identifying information that were not a match. The lawyer did not even do the simplest checking. I filed with the IARDC  and nothing happened.

Debt collectors are very knowledgable in what they do. We are professionals. But debtors are not stupid and should be expected to do their own research and educate themselves to participate in their defense. Why should a creditor have to explain to a debtor how to avoid paying their debt. By the time it's reached litigation, those conversations should have already occured and the debtor should be ready to offer his defense without being "taught" by the person to whom he owes money.

As a creditor collecting my own debt, I assert that by the time I move to litgation, I've exhausted all other forms of collection. I've talked to, emailed, and snail mailed the debtor. I've tried to negotiate a payment plan or settlement offer all to no avail. Litigation is our last attempt. Once we are litigation, we present our best case and let the debtor present their defense. My experience is that debtors don't participate in their defense out of either fear or lack of knowledge about the legal process. But the burden of educating the debtor shouldn't be put on the creditor's shoulders. If debtor's prefer to ignore the issue, then a default judgment is justified. There should be consequences to the inaction of the debtor.

My company calls, auto-dials, emails, and snail mails customers many times before they are sent to a collection agency. Many debtors simply refuse to respond to the original debtor. They only make payment after the account is assigned to a collection agency -- akin to seeing just how far they can go before there's a consequence to not making payment. Requiring a validation notice from the owner of the debt should be optional on the creditor's part. The FDCPA requires the collection agency to send their first notice after the debt is assigned. More notices from the creditor are useless and expensive. And the single most frequently used excuse of any debtor is "I didn't receive the letter/invoice/statement". A first class letter costs $0.55 minimum (inclusive of postage, paper, and envelope). That cost does not include overhead and employee cost. Multiply that cost by the number of notices and statements already sent (and ignored) and you begin to see the true cost of collection.

Debt collectors should not be permitted to harass a debtor's ex-spouse by repeatedly calling the ex-spouse. Debt collectors are known to use the old phone number of the debtor that now belongs to the ex-spouse exclusively. Even though the ex-spouse tells the collector to remove her phone number from the collector's records, the collector does not, and then repeatedly calls her trying to get to the debtor. Collectors must be required to remove her phone number from their records at her first request and not be permitted to call her again. Otherwise, she has no recourse to get the harassment to stop.

I don't know if technology allows collectors to distinguish land lines from cell phones. It is fair for collectors to use info provided on the application for credit. Collectors should be allowed to assume that the mailing address of record is an accurate indication of the debtor's time zone. Creditors periodically request updates of contact info in some cases; this would be a good idea for all to do. Mailing address should take priority for determining time zone unless the debtor advises otherwise. As mentioned previously, people with cell phones may move from one locale to another without changing their area code.

In theory this seems like a reasonable policy, but how can collectors know where a debtor is if they are calling his or her cell phone? Knowingly calling third parties should be prohibited across the board. It is no one else's business what goes on between creditors and their debtors. Calls to a person's boss or family can cause further financial and domestic problems, neither of which will help with getting the debt paid.

Debtors should be able to leave a message for a specific debtor, the name of their company and request a call-back at a specified number. When a consumer returns this type of call, the collector or debtor should be required to give them the mini-Miranda warning. There is no need for collectors to leave messages revealing the nature of their calls. The Health Information Privacy and Portability Act prohibits disclosure of protected information to unauthorized parties and the same should apply to debt collectors.

Calling a debtor at work is counter-intuitive; if collectors are continuously calling someone at work, other employees may report it to the debtor's supervisor. Most companies have established rules about receiving or making personal calls from company or cell phones during an employee's working hours. If a collector or creditor calls a debtor on his/her cell phone and is informed that the debtor is at work, the call should be terminated. No calls to employers should be allowed  as this jeopardizes the debtor's job. How does that help in debt collection? It doesn't.

Most landlines and cell phones have caller ID technology ; if the number comes up showing a toll-free number or an unknown caller, many consumers will let such calls go to voice mail. Voice mail messages need to be discreet. No one needs their kids hearing messages from debt collectors. Anyone returning a call regarding a voice mail message should be informed by a live customer service rep of the mini Miranda warning. This should be done only after the person returning the call to the collector verifies his or her identity as the debtor.

Consumers should not incur additional costs for cell phone calls, texting or voice messaging in relation to collections. The more costs assessed to a debtor, the less money they have to pay their creditors. Debt collectors and creditors should be required to stop all modes of communication to a device that the debtor indicates does not provide free communications whether calls or texts.

There should be a monetary "floor" required before debt collectors can pursue uncollected debts in court. The idea that corporations that already charge puninshing interest rates and fees can clog the court systems trying to collect a few hundred bucks from someone who is unemployed, ill, or otherwise unable to pay is counter-productive. There should be a minimum amount of consumer debt owed before creditors can sue debtors. Another issue with using state and local courts to settle debt collection suits is that it burdens jurisdictions already heavily burdened with cases and strapped for cash.

I can't comment on any of this, but it would seem appropriate for Federal law to establish a framework of requirements for states to meet. This would level the playing field for debtors and creditors in all states. and would provide an equal basis for states to proceed with adding or amending their own laws affecting debt collection lawsuits.

Consumers should be aware of who is handling collection procedures. The seller of any consumer debt should be required to notify the debtor of which debt owed to which creditor, is being sold by xyz organization to 123 debt collector. The effective date of the debt sale and contact info for the new collector should be included.

Consumer owing the debt should be contacted about any third party offer to pay their debt. Anyone paying debt for someone else should be required to provide their identity to the creditor and debtor.

This kind of thing is likely determined by family court law in the jurisdiction where the debtor lives. Community property law, divorce or separation agreements and issues of domestic violence laws all come into play in these kinds of circumstances.

I do not believe that it would have mattered. It seemed that the Attorney/debt collector was not looking for the actual debtor I believe that all that they were trying to do was to make a quick buck. They did a couple of shady things with this case. For a solution; the laws should be written so the common lay person can understand. If I had known that a validation request would not be considered I would not have wasted my time and paid even though it was NOT my debt.

I have personally witnessed how judges perceive credit card debt cases, and I believe they have strayed too far towards the debt collectors. Judges simply decide whether a default has occurred, and once a judge declares a debtor in default, the adjudicated debtor has no pleading rights. Alleged credit card and student loan defaulters should have the right to declare their default an Involuntary Default and be allowed to pay back the debt with no more penalties, fees or interest rate charges, called Debt Neutrality. Debt Neutrality is making of a debt neutral so that it does not continue to indenture a defaulter in a never ending cycle of ongoing interest rate charges, penalties and fees. Involuntary defaults should allow the debtor to have the debt reset to where it was at the time of the default minus any payments made. As it stands now, Strategic Defaulters are given much better treatment than Involuntary Defaulters, in large part due to Involuntary Defaulters not being able to plead their default as being Involuntary.

Debt Collection companies get a very unfair debt negotiation advantage against an alleged defaulter when they hire an unscrupulous service company that has lied about giving a proper service or subservice to the alleged debtor's residence. Judges do not seem to understand that if a service company will fraudulently state in court documents that they served a defaulter or subserved someone at the residence when in fact they did not, that the debt collector can become very arrogant and cocky as to how they negotiate with the alleged defaulter. In a nutshell, if the debt collector's one sided terms are not met, they will simply hire the service company who will provide service even if it is a false service. Judges rationalize that the mail service is an adequate notification without realizing that what a false service does is embolden the debt collection company to not properly negotiate a debt with an alleged defaulter because they have total control over the service aspect, even if fraudulently obtained. This need to be fixed and false servers need to be fined along with the debt collection companies who hire them and keep hiring them even after they receive complaints of false service.

As a mortgage lender for an FDIC-insured bank, I'm astounded at the number of customers who sit across from me and are wholly dumbfounded when I tell them their loan request is denied because of outstanding collections. For certain there are some people who knew full well they would have collections items and are playing dumb (and not doing so very well). But many of them had no clue, and 90% of those collections are medical in nature. If the CFPB truly is about protecting the interests of the consumer, then the debt collection process needs to be simplified drastically in regard to collection items (medical, utilities, etc.). after 60 days of non-payment, the account can be closed. The creditor sends a certified letter to the last known address of the debtor, informing them they have 30 days to bring the account current or make other payment arrangements,  or the account will be turned over to a collection agency. Said letter also needs to contain the contact information for that collection agency, so they know in advance who to contact if they don't respond within 30 days. Yes, a lot of those letters will be returned undeliverable or will end up in someone else's hands. But that would demonstrate a good faith effort by the creditors to work with the debtors before passing the buck to a collection agency. The added benefit for the government is the increase in certified letters passing through the USPS!

Having gone through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy I can tell you that debt collector phone calls were the worst part of the bankruptcy experience. Massachusetts has it right limiting the number of calls debt collectors can make. That would remove one of the favorite illegal tactics debt collectors use to harass debtors. Some debt collectors would threaten to put us on robocalls so that our phone rang hourly until we agreed to a repayment loan schedule. Or they would threaten to call my spouse at work to see if he would be "more cooperative" and agree to a loan repayment schedule even after being informed that his workplace did not allow debt collection calls. Nothing phased these people  and they appeared to enjoy verbally abusing me. Informing them that we wanted all debt collection to be written was also ignored. I could accurately predict who was calling by the day and time of the calls. Chase Bank called every Tuesday morning at 9AM. Bank of America called every Monday morning at 10:30AM. These calls were always professional and appreciated. I followed specific instructions given by our bankruptcy attorney who did not want the debt collectors to know that we were planning on filing bankruptcy in a few months. So I faithfully answered every single debt collector call for almost six months. I politely confirmed my identity. I confirmed I owed the debt  and then I politely told each call that I could not start to repay the debt at this time. The banks/credit cards accepted this without a problem and remained professional. Others like GE Capital and the vacation time share debt collectors would then start with the abusive comments. Calling me a "deadbeat" and swearing at me was popular. Another popular threat was how they would harass us nonstop until they got their money. What finally put a stop to the unethical tactics was when they would call and inform me that I was being taped I then informed them that I too was now taping their phone calls. Most immediately hung up. A few would clean up their act and then act in a professional manner. The ability to tape debt collection calls is a powerful tool for the debtor to have and I would encourage this agency to grant debtors this right. Nothing cleaned up the bad behavior like knowing they were being taped.

The price of paper (bad debt) varies depending on the collectability of the debt based on info known about the debtor and also varies based on the amount of documentation purchased from the original creditor. Most debt buyers only pay for a couple of recent credit card statements. They may provide a "bill of sale" but these never identify a specific account being sold and reference a master purchase contract which is never provided.

I did the same thing and the response was immediate to stop the abusive behaviors.Like you most debt collectors just hang up.Those who stayed on immediately changed their tone of voice and behavior.I would advise anyone receiving verbally abusive, harassing, or threatening phone calls from debt collection calls buy a cheap telephone recording device and to use it when they call.When they inform you at the mini-Miranda point interrupt them and tell them that you too are now recording all debt collection calls.It's the most powerful tool any debtor can use.

while this isn't the best forum for me to go into my company's entire collection process, we work a debt for at least 120 days with letters, live agent calls, robo calls, emails, mailed invoices, and by suspending subscription service (where allowed) as part of our collection campaign. Even then, we only go to litigation after the debtor has been unresponsive to our attempts to contact them. I've found that if a debtor talks to their creditors, many times creditors will take their situation into account. I've offered lengthy repayment plans, reduced or waived interest or late fees, or partial settlement for those explain their hardship. But if a debtor is uncooperative or doesn't respond to our attempts to work out a balance, what other alternatives do creditors have?

The CFPB should require debt sellers to contact the debtor and inform them the debt has been sold. Additionally, ALL pertinent information must be given to the debtor to eliminate any confusion. Furthermore, the seller of the debt must be required and enforced to annotate the debtors credit report with the sale to help eliminate confusion and in a way to not increase the bad debt. Essentially, debts that are sold sometimes appear as two seperate debts on a consumers report which increases the penalty of having bad debt. A consumer should not be penalized twice for 1 debt.

The CFPB should ban workplace calls completely. Consumers provided a home phone number when they take on the debt and that should be the number they call to collect it. Communicating by registered/certified letter should also be the alternate method not workplace calls. Second Massachusetts limiting the total number of calls is a fabulous idea. We don't throw debtors in prison today yet the ridiculous amount of abuse and scorn they must endure is totally unacceptable. CFPB desperately needs to clean up the debt collection industry.

Current debt substantiation requirements all suffer from the same significant shortcoming in that they fail to address the often symbiotic relationship between first-line creditors, collectors, reporting agencies, consumer data clearinghouses, buyers of bad debt, and others industry players. Each has a vested profit motive in the "validation" of debt. Without appropriate disincentive--i.e., enforcement of rules and stiff penalties for non-compliance--corners are cut and quid pro quo-type behaviors begin to surface. Consumers hold few cards and have to play against a stacked deck. The validation process should involve more than merely inquiring with the creditor about the validity of the debt or the identity of the debtor, and failure to observe all the necessary steps--in the sunshine, no less--should have severe consequences. The best deterrent would be putting the power back in the hands of the (truly-wronged) consumer through the inclusion of "private attorney general" style enforcement mechanism. Awarding attorneys' fees and damages, with the ability to elect either actual or meaningful statutory damages (similar to the scheme introduced by Congress into the copyright statutes), would create serious disincentives for anyone involved in unscrupulous validation practices.

The consumer should be allowed to record all calls for proof of conversation with collectors. And once a collector received a notice to not contact a debtor at their workplace it should be required that they do not even for "location"

The entire point of collectors calling debtors at work is to intimidate and cause fear of loss of employment to the debtor and the practice should be outlawed unless the debtor opts in to receive calls there.Its well known that companies like Sallie Mae will continue to call debtors at work even after being told not to.

I was following the advice of our bankruptcy attorney. I was allowed to tell creditors only a limited amount of information. I could confirm- my identify, that yes I owed the debt, and third that I was not able to start repaying my debt. No I was not allowed to tell the debt collectors that we would be filing bankruptcy. It took almost six months to complete tasks prior to notifying creditors about the bankruptcy. During that time I was subjected to verbal abuse, threats, illegal intimidation tactics, and outright lies. The tape recorder completely stopped the bad behavior. It's amazing what debt collectors will say and do when they call debtors. It's a totally different story what they want recorded. The best money you will ever spend is a cheap $20-25 telephone tape recorder.

There needs to be some federal protections for the consumer and a clear appeals process. The state run by private company programs seem to see the alleged debtor as already guilty. For example, some consumer groups have suggested that entities may not be including a "clear and conspicuous statement" that the consumer may dispute the validity of the alleged bad check violation. What kind of financial incentives are there for these companies to meet certain benchmarks that may not be in the consumer's best interest? It kind of sounds like those arbitration programs for credit card debt where everything was stacked in the favor of the creditor.

That is not going to work. The burden of proof in the American Justice System is bore by the one who is making the accusations. Some debtors are going to lie and say that a debt is not theirs when it actually is, but that is the nature of the beast with debt collections. Innocent until proven guilty is the rules of the game. Otherwise I, as a debt collector, can accuse anyone of anything owning any amount and extort money from innocent people. Debt collection is about collecting debt, not about making accusations and extortions.

I like the Summary of Rights idea. I think that a validation letter and even an initial communication letter should included of Summary of Rights for State Laws and Fed Laws. This would help two fold: both the debtors/consumers and the debt collecting companies. The debtor/consumers would know their rights  and the collectors would then also know the particular rights for the states that they are collecting in. This shouldn't be burdensome at all  since the CRA already include Summary of Rights as do employers who check credit.

There should never be a fee for payment. In fact, in about 1/3 of the states have state laws that prohibit any fees/surcharges for payment by credit/debit cards (unless it is a government agency). if a debt collector accepts credit/debit cards for payment, there should not be any fees for payment processing. Nor should there be any fees for payment processing for any other payment method for that matter. debt collection companies should also be able to accept prepaid debit cards for payment as a means of privacy and security for the debtors, rather than access to a bank account.

When two parties engage in a lawsuit, each side presents the evidence they have supporting their assertions. As a collector, I provide proof of the debt The debtor is also expected to present some proof that the debt is not theirs. Yes, the assumption is innocent until proven guilty but you have to provide evidence to support your claim of innocence. If I offer a signed document that says you agreed to the purchase and documentation that supports that you did not pay, I have fulfilled my side of the burden of proof. The debtor also bears a burden of proof in our system. That's what the judge is for - to hear both sides, weigh the evidence, and make a fair decision based on the evidence and arguments presented.

If there already isn't a law or rule at the fed level for when what happens to time barred debts when a debtor leaves the purview of one states SOL and now resides in another states SOL, there needs to be. It should be clear that if a debtor changes states, which SOL should come into play.

I think there should be a fed law that should clearly state that any partial payment might revive the SOL for suit. How consumers get a phone call/letter telling them they have a debt and they just blindly pay it or make partial payments in order to just stop getting the phone calls? Lots. And the debt might not even be theirs,  but they pay it anyways thinking that they might have a old debt that they forgot to take care of. The problem with that is, that the debt then is revived, the debt collector sues, and the judge tells the debtor "well, if this wasn't your debt then why did you agree to make partial payments?" Then the judge will make favor in the debt collector for a revived debt that the debtor was not even responsible for in the first place. This scenario happens every day of the week. And the consumer had thought they were doing the right thing, but the debt collector is actually taking advantage.

Actually there should always be more communication about specific things, rather than less. More communication from the Original Creditors that an account will be turned over to a collector and when. And when a debt collector then turns it over or sells to someone else there should be more communication about who. Just like when mortgages are sold to other servicers, the borrowers get letters informing them of who now owns their mortgage and who now to send payment to. This should be standard practice for debt collectors. Explaining to the debtor that they have turned the account to someone else and that all payment and communication should now be directed to the new guy (even if no payments were sent to the first debt collector. Because there are debtors who can't make payment now but can later, and if they start sending payment to an old debt collector via an old letter they got in the mail, then debtors attempts to actually resolve the debt go by the wayside. More communication about who/what/where/how is necessary.

The enforcement mechanism of the FDCPA is laughable from the point of view of the debtor. For example, a debt collector said that since they are out of the country they are not required to adhere to the FDCPA. Luckily, I knew better,  but most folk don't. The CFPB's voluntary reporting combined with proxy enforcement power may curb the industry's activities, and may be cheaper and faster than class action lawsuits.

I am a clerk at a local city court. I am the civil clerk  and I feel that debtors are treated extremely unfairly by debt collection laws. The Court cannot give legal advice so it is saddening to have to try and explain and console upset litigants who have no idea what they are in for. I think there should be more avenues for pro se litigants who cannot afford to retain a private attorney  (which is 95 % of the litigants in my city). I can say that most people do not answer summonses because they either were not properly served or they just straight up do not care, or most often, do not understand the legalese. BUT, I do have to say that I get many litigants who call and ask what they do now that they are served. On the occasions that people do file answers, most of them are in letter form, not a "legal" verified answer. Most debt collection attorneys jump right on that and request a summary judgment. Our Court does not turn away letters,  and we send a copy to the attorney and set the matter up for a pre trial conference with a judge or court attorney to help try to get both parties together to come to some sort of resolution. The Court does have to adhere to a scheduling policy for these conferences,  but we are very flexible  if a defendant has a scheduling conflict we try to accommodate them as best we can. When summonses are filed with the court, half of them have tons of information about the debt, others only have the amount due! I find that sometimes it's hard for litigants to obtain further proving documents from attorneys, even with the court telling them they have to. When entering default judgments, I take my time and examine the whole file, like comparing the contents of the summons/complaint and the default judgment submitted, re-checking the affidavit of service of the summons (to make sure the defendant had the legal time to answer the summons), and ensuring that attached to the default judgment is the proper documentation as to purchasing the debt, a non-military affidavit, etc. I also make sure that they are being charged the proper interest rate and court costs. The bottom line is that the debtors still do not have enough and/or sufficient laws to protect them, and the Court's hands are tied based on these laws, even if they wanted to help, they couldn't. I know the Court is to remain impartial, but in a small city, everybody knows everybody and sometimes it's hard to see these practices occurring.

Collection Agency's' should be REQUIRED by law to show their phone number when calling a debtor. Most if not all come up "unknown". If they are a legitimate company then they should have no problem showing their number. If I call them, and my number is blocked, I can't get thru until I unblock my number. If they truly are legitimate, they should want to do things fair and above board.

Agreed. And it should be their real phone number. So that when you miss their phone call and try to call them back, it should go to the real company. And not say something like "the call can not be completed as dialed." I mean, what is the point in that. Some debtors can't get to their phone before it goes to the answering machine  and if the collectors don't leave a message, the debtor will try to call back. But then the call can't be completed when you try to call back. So, really what was the point of the call. Many debtors would just assume it was a scam call. Increasing Right Party Contacts should be the goal. And that goal can only be reached if the real phone number is showing up on calller id.

They could at least start with address and area code of debtor"s phone number. And I would say that the reach would be at least as far as the local commuting area. So for a city like Boston, there's Boston, Chelsea, and the other surrounding areas. Now, if a debtor from NY traveled to Boston for the marathon, for example, that would be much harder for a collector to have a reasonable expectation of a debtor"s whereabouts. But once a debtor has identified his/herself within the reach of the commuting area of the place of emergency, then perhaps the exemption period should kick in. In a place like Newtown, or Colorado, if a collector has a reasonable belief that a debtor may have been an employee of the school or movie theater (if they can't identify the debtor being in the local commuting area by address/phone number), then they should also stop collection for the exemption period. So, place of employment, address, phone number, and debtors self-identifying their whereabouts, could be ways that debt collectors could/should have reason to believe the location of a debtor.

It would be a good idea to create a national database of collectors and assign them an ID number just like the IRS. Require them to state their name and ID number just like IRS employees do. This would allow debtors to easily identify an abusive collector or just call a debt collection agency and ask to speak to a specific employee. If they call and leave a voicemail they are required to state their ID number somewhere in the recording. It would be good for both debtors and collectors.

This is a collectors favorite. They call over and over to harass debtors  and they should be limited to one call per day with a required voicemail stating their purpose.

The courts should also mandate that if a debtor has reached out to the creditor in an attempt to negotiate the creditor must continue to try to reach a settlement rather than seeking judgment against the debtor. Also, the collection agency should not be able to add interest on top of debt that seek judgment for if the debtor agrees to pay  since they will make a profit over what they paid the original creditor. Basically these so called "attorneys" (just another form of ambulance chaser in my book) are just forcing bankruptcies upon people who would be willing to work a deal  and then they and the courts and the government are whining about what the bankruptcies do to the economy and the bottom line. Last time I checked even in a court of law you can't play both sides.

A lot of excellent points made by MLegz13. My elderly parents needed help with day to day activities even if they were too proud to say anything. I stopped my award winning video business to be their CareGiver. Once the savings ran out, I had to default after 15 years of having a perfect credit card payment history. The debt collectors were constantly accusing me of being a "refuse to pay" even though I said I acknowledge the debt but had no income at the moment. It is this type of scenario that requires debts be frozen where they were at the time of default and in exchange the debtor agrees to pay off the debt, even if the initial monthly payments are just for a couple of dollars. What this does is free the debtor's phone lines so they can completely focus on moving forward rather than engage in pointless rat a tat with repetitive debt collection callers. It's why I started the Debt Neutrality Petition as well. If you click on the link PLEASE read the comments left by some of the 500 plus people who have signed the petition. Even a debt collector signed the petition, their comment speaks volumes of truth, as did all the others as well. Debt Neutrality Petition. __URL__

How about allowing arbitrators to not be bound entirely by the law, but also by common sense when it comes credit card defaults? Common sense tells us that if a Colorado flood washes away a community, those in the community are possibly not going to be able to pay their credit card bills for a few months. Common sense tells us that a medical emergency, being the victim of a hit and run accident, destruction of a home, or becoming an unpaid CareGiver for a family member should take precedence over the monthly payment requirement.  This is not about debt forgiveness,  its about declaring a debt neutral, no more penalties, fees or interest rate charges are applied to the debt, and the debtor agrees to pay off the debt in a reasonable manner, even if it takes 10 years to do so. __URL__

If a debt is to be sold, the owner of the debt should be required to send an itemized statement to the debtor. The statement should have a large-type header, something like, "[NAME OF CREDITOR] IS SELLING THIS DEBT TO [NAME OF DEBT BUYER]." This would give the debtor another chance to pay in the simplest way, before getting tangled up in idiot phone calls,  and it would help the debtor identify the debt.

If a debt is to be turned over to a collection agency, the owner of the debt should be required to send a fully itemized statement to the debtor. The statement should have a large-type header, something like, "[NAME OF CREDITOR] IS TURNING THIS DEBT OVER TO [NAME], A DEBT COLLECTION AGENCY." This would give the debtor another chance to pay in the simplest way, before getting tangled up in idiot phone calls, and it would help the debtor identify the debt. The debt owner already has the itemized bill; it would be just a matter of copying it again and sending it. there should be a requirement that the original creditor make a true, good-faith effort to contact the debtor. I've dealt with those who do this, and those who don't. Some will send you a bill, and then when they get no answer, call you and check the address, which is often wrong. Some, it seems, hardly wait for the ink to dry on their first bill before they turn it over to collection.

I think probably the benefits of giving debt collectors and buyers access to these documents would NOT worth the costs unless the documents have to be included with the validation notice. If the debt collectors were anxious to be sure they had the right debtor, sure, great. But I don't think they are. The actual guy on the phone is only anxious to get the money; he doesn't really care where it comes from or whether the debt is legal. Giving him the information, without giving it to the debtor, probably wouldn't be much good. And maybe I'm being unfair. Maybe these companies are strict about making sure the debt is collected from the right person. Naaah....

Payment processor Visa has general information and the corresponding state statutes about the 10 states that prohibit companies from charging credit/debit card fees located on their website. Texas, which most people would think would be business friendly, is actually really consumer friendly when it comes to these fees, for example. Texas has had a long-standing state law against credit card fees, and just recently this year created a new state law to cover against debit card fees and other stored value cards (like prepaid debit cards). __URL__ __URL__ __URL__ __URL__ And, no, I do not have any knowledge of if debt collectors are charging debtors payment processing fees or not, but if they are--especially in the states that forbid this practice--they should not be allowed to do so. And I further believe that in the remaining states that do not have any laws forbidding credit/debit cards surcharges, that a fed reg/law should forbid debt collectors in all states from doing so.

Yes, I am also concerned with whether or not collectors should identify themselves in a message, or if they should be more general in identifying who they are in a voice message as to not invade the privacy of the debtor for whomever else may share the same answering machine or otherwise may over hear the message. So far, I have purposely remained neutral on this matter because I have yet to form an opinion. I can see both sides of the arguments. I think I lean more to wanting the collectors to be more discrete and general about who is calling, but I still am not sure. The big concern that is more concrete is definitely the phone number caller id, in that it should be the true number of the business and (if a message is left) should also be the call back number.

I would like something that addresses the amount of times a debt collector can contact someone other than the debtor. My husband's exwife has several debts and we are sometimes contacted several times a day and often at night to find out if we are in contact with her they have been divorced 36 years

Please include calls to family and friends of debtor. We are called frequently to pass on messages for people that have our last name, some of them we don't know.

I do not believe that use of social media should be allowed to initiate or to conduct any legal or other sensitive arrangements or communications to and from debt collectors. There are a couple of things that I've noticed about social media: social media is a fad, and an outlet. People use social media as an outlet for the narcissistic/public/storybook/memorable moments side of their lives. And recent evidence shows that fewer teens and young adults are using facebook and twitter. And I am most certain that no social media user would like for their private life to become public life by dealing with a debt collector on facebook. Nobody likes to be in debt and have bill collectors chasing them, In writing" to me, means a letter delivered in the mail. I would also accept an interpretation to mean delivered by email but only on official company letterhead documents. And only if first requested by the debtor and not first initiated by the collector. But I can not accept "in writing" to mean messages and communication sent via social media. I think that E-Sign consent should only be valid for the original creditor. And any and every collector who then gets involved must get the debtor to consent E-Sign with them. The reason is because there are some things that I, as a consumer, am comfortable with dealing online or through email with my original creditors, but there are things that I know I would not feel comfortable dealing with online/email with a debt collector. So E-Sign should not be blanket consent for anyone and everyone.

I am sorry to hear about this situation. This kind of abusive behavior is upsetting to hear as a consumer. They don't need to "speak" with anyone. You/your daughter are perfectly within your legal rights to ask the phone calls to stop and to communicate by other means. And the collectors who are refusing to honor this request is in violation. Moreover, they should not be contacting you nor they should be contacting you/your daughter 10 times a day. This is clearly excessive and abusive. I would like to also mention, that although they do have a point about the federal loans can usually be placed into deferment, debt collectors are not fiduciaries and are not acting with nor are capable of providing financial advice that is in the best interest of the consumer/debtor. The collectors will say anything and do anything just to get paid. They should not be allowed to offer advice on what bills to pay and how to pay them. This sort of "advice" can be detrimental to consumers/debtors. Perhaps the CFPB should allow collectors to offer referrals on financial advice, but they should not allow collectors to outright give financial advice.

I am an experienced recipient of collection calls. As I have explained in another post here, I live in a fairly large metro area, and whenever anyone with my very common last name and first initial skips town without paying his/her bills, I'm the one who gets the calls from the debt collectors. I know that a call about "an important business matter," is a call about a debt. I have received many of these kinds of calls. Whenever a debt collector calls me and leaves a message without a name, it doesn't take me very long to figure out that the call is from a debt collector. If the debt collector calls and leaves a name, that debt collector is revealing to me, an unrelated third party, that the individual has a debt in collection. I consider this to be a violation of the spirit of the FDCPA if not the letter. Whenever a debt collector calls me, I am burdened with the knowledge that I now know the name of someone else who has a debt in collection. I've gotten any number of the calls described in #4 telling me not to listen if I'm not the named individual. The big problem with that is that, one again, the name of a debtor is being revealed to me, and then there's the added dilemma of the fact that now my phone number has been programmed into a debt collector's robo dialer. When that happens, the calls continue to come. I always disobey the instructions and listen to the message. I then call the debt collector to report a case of mistaken identity. It's the only way to stop the calls. In all the collection calls I have gotten over the years, I have received only one message with the "mini-Miranda" warning. When I called the debt collector to report another case of mistaken identity I was connected with an individual in a call center in India. After I told the woman she had the wrong person, I thanked her for the "mini-Miranda" and she hung up on me. I don't have any answers, just lots of experience. I hope someone finds this information useful.

I agree. Most creditors already have this information in contracts and other correspondence to the debtor. This additional notice is unnecessary would be cumbersome and costly.

I would suggest that debtors who INVOLUNTARILY defaulted on a debt don't have the money to hire an attorney, so they don't see the point to going to court without an attorney. Why doesn't the court give access to free legal counsel to debt defaulters the way they do to those who are accused of committing a crime?

My deceased daughter(she passed 2 years ago) had some debt. We continue to receive calls from debt collectors even after we have asked them not to call us anymore. My wife has filed complaints with the Oregon State Justice dept. to complain about the harrassment. Why can't these collectors do their research on the debtor, before they harrass the parents!!

By the time a file reaches litigation, the debtor has already received at least one prior opportunity to resolve the debt with the collector (the initial demand letter, which by law must inform the debtor of his/her right to challenge the veracity of the debt being pursued). By making default judgment more difficult, the CFPB would only be rewarding the debtors who choose to take no action to resolve their complaints. Furthermore, the CFPB arguably has no authority to impose new, more burdensome requirements upon litigants in state court fora. Doing so would constitute an admission that state court rules of civil procedure deny due process in other types of proceedings that are not granted the "benefit" of Federal oversight.

It is unwise to require that the debt collector send sensitive personal information to the debtor (e.g., SSN, account number as such a requirement would expose the debtor to the danger of ID theft.

For attorney debt collectors, being required to provide a list of all the rights the consumer may have comes perilously close to the provision of legal advice; even if it doesn't cross that line, the unsophisticated debtor may believe that an attorney is acting as a neutral court officer rather than as an advocate for an adverse party. I've had debtors ask me "Do I need to come to court for this?" after I've sued them.

There is now a class of "consumer representatives" which obtains from debtors a signed "Power of Attorney" and who then claim to be authorized to act as the consumer's attorney for purposes of debt resolution. They routinely seek to avoid the debt, most commonly by not answering their phones. My current practice is to advise the relevant state bar of the unauthorized practice of law by these jokers; perhaps a clarification statement that such persons must be licensed to practice law in the state in which the debt is being collected would cut down on the confusion.

In fact, it is a gross distortion of the law for the CFPB to claim that suit on a debt outside of the statute of limitations period is per se unfair, deceptive or misleading. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (and most state civil rules), the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense which must be pleaded by the defendant; if it is not, the defense is considered to have been waived. The purpose of the defense is to enable a party to avoid being disadvantaged by the long delay, loss of evidentiary documents, memory fading, etc.; if the debtor doesn't claim that they are disadvantaged by the delay, then the delay clearly isn't so long as to preclude a vigorous defense.

I was not the one with debt. I was a mediator trying to help. The people with this situation sometimes ignore the first notice to them and don't ask for a validation letter. Others, I believe, do not read it carefully and see they have a small window of time to dispute the claim. I think the original notice letter to the debtor should HIGHLIGHT the part about a validation letter. I also, think the original creditor should be required to help resolve disputes instead of debtors or third parties like me only being able to talk with the collection agency. Probably 50% of the agencies I have dealt with do not follow existing regulations. Without penalties they never will. The few that are reasonable and follow the rules are a pleasure to deal with, as a third party.

Probably won't find any legislation since people who have allegedly defaulted on a debt aren't necessarily going to tell the world, or create a lobby for their cause. Debt Defaults and Debt Collections are a one sided issue in which judges have been constrained to simply determine if a default has occurred, or not. The lawyers primarily work with strategic defaulters because S.D.'s have some source of money or income available to pay both the attorney and a partial portion of the debt. Involuntary Defaulters are left to fend for themselves because they don't have money to pay a lawyer. Debt Neutrality, in which an involuntary defaulter agrees they owe the debt and simply want's to be able to pay it down based on the amount the debt was at the time of the default, with no more penalties, interest rate charges, or fees, even if it takes 10 years to pay off the debt, would possibly alleviate a large amount of unnecessary court cases. And of course, once the very modest initial payments were set up, the account would no longer register as a negative on a debtor's credit score or credit rating. And to safeguard fraud, the debtor would not be able to keep borrowing larger and larger amounts of money until after their defaults were paid in full. It's a very logical solution in my opinion. Judges should be able to use logic to solve the growing backlog of credit card default cases.

Email communication is a huge advantage for all involved parties. Emails provide consumers with much better tools to control how they are being contacted. First, if treating emails as "in writing" (as they should), disputing a debt or demanding that collectors cease communication is much easier. Second, setting rules to hide collection notices is a powerful tool not available in any other communication medium. 3rd party disclosure is therefore a lesser concern. Third, email delivery is fast, and facilitates an efficient process, where less communications can be made to reach a settlement. Everything is in writing. Fourth, email is significantly less confrontational than phone calls  and causes much less stress to recipients. Fifth, email is better than recording in keeping record of communication, making it even harder for collectors to hide acts of non compliance. Email should be allowed, while keeping the sensitive parts of the message (disclosures, personal details etc) hidden - as an attachment or as a link that is part of an email. Yes, email is more cost efficient to collectors which is why using email should be conditional on collectors not charging the debtors any fees for their payments. The added profitability should be shares with the consumer.

Email rules allows hiding emails and routing them in ways that surpass any other communication method. In addition, since email "sender ID" is easier to demand and maintain, debtors will have an easier time managing what communication they receive, and when. As a result, there is no necessity for forcing specific times of email delivery.

Email isn't easier to access or view off the debtor's screen than a call a call's content is actually harder to hide if you receive it among other people), text message or SMS. The way regulation should handle sensitive information is by mandating that some information be an attachment, or in a link provided in the email, rather than the body of an email. If the attachment is encrypted or details are stored on a secured web page, no one will be able to access them. In fact, they will be much better protected than any other information relayed to the debtor. Work emails should be handled differently, much like calls to a work place, which can also be accessed by the employer.

I have a lot of concerns with emails. Email clients have privacy/security settings that do not allow the sender to know if/when an email has been or was received. The problem is that even with these privacy/security settings, senders are able to get around these settings. This is widely used by spammers and hackers. All of the spam experts all say not to open emails that are spam or potential spam,  because the spammers are so good at manipulating and getting around the privacy/security settings and force the recipients email client to inform the sender of when/if an email was opened. Also, I do not like the idea that collectors can insert links in emails. The more unscrupulous collectors and unscrupulous employees can insert links that are harmful to the security of the user"s computers and offensive to the recipients (like pornographic material). Just think about how many collectors still (even after all of the lawsuits) use offensive and abusive language over the telephone, just think about what kind of harm these bad apples would be able to do with emails. I also I do not like the emails  because of the ease with which collection companies can sell the email lists to marketers. Many decades ago, one of my neighbors was a debt collector. She would tell me that if they couldn't get money out of the debtors then we make money off of them by selling your address and personal information to marketing companies. I have huge concerns for allowing collectors from using emails. Any rules that allow collectors to use email should come with deliberate care and attention to the privacy/security, materials and content, and the restriction of selling email lists. I also worry about true and accurate identification of emails. Spammers/hackers are able to manipulate how emails are presented and the name of the email address that they send with. there should also be rules restricting collectors are manipulating and spoofing their email addresses.

If emails are allowed, they should not be allowed to be sent outside of what is the acceptable time for phone calls. I would like to restrict the time to inside normal business hours for the locale of the debtor, because no business email should ever be sent from the office outside normal business hours. This is basic and normal business etiquette for emails. But a compromise could be made for what is accepted for phone calls. However, I would like to see no emails sent on Sundays. The USPS does not operate on Sundays and neither should emails of a business nature.

Debtors often respond with "I don't owe anything", which is vague and makes it harder to cater for their needs. If any rule making is needed, it is about the types of disputes a debtor may bring forth and the documentation needed for both the substantiation of that dispute leaving the option for a dispute to be deemed frivolous and what constitutes satisfaction of the dispute or proper proof. Otherwise, this is left for negotiation between individual collectors and debtors.

If you want to instantly level the playing field, make any credit card debt above and beyond the moment of default, disputable. Disputability of any amount over the amount at the moment of default would instantly get both the credit card companies and the debt collectors working with the consumer on a reasonable plan going forward, no? As it stands now, credit card companies can and usually do jump the interest rate up to as high as 29.9% and may even let the account stay in default  as they rack up frequent default points on the debtor. When I gave up my regional emmy award winning video business to become a caregiver for both of my parents, eventually savings ran out and I notified each of my credit card vendors ahead of any default. NONE could offer me anything other than, "pay your bill on time". If instead the credit card companies know that once the default occurs they cannot accrue any more penalties, fees or interest rate charges on the debt, they will bend over backwards to work with the alleged defaulter to get them to pay down the debt. Citibank rate jacked my never late payment 15 year old credit card account by 5,000 dollars. I dispute that amount of excess in lieu of why I had to default, but Citibank does not care, nor does the debt collector. The amount of the debt reverted to what it was at the time of the default, you can bet citibank would be working hard to work with me.

With increased and onerous liability for making calls and sending letters to debtors, creditors and debt buyers have had little option but to file suit rather than repeatedly attempt to contact an uncooperative or uncommunicative debtor. Most complaints provide adequate and identifying information about the debt. In my experience, most debtors don't feel taken advantage of by lawsuits, they simply understand they owe the debt so there is little point in filing an answer or taking time to appear in court. In fact, the vast majority never respond to a Federal Law letter inviting them to dispute the debt. Filing suits and appearing in court is expensive and time consuming for creditors and debt buyer, but there is little alternative, nor should there be as these matters have always been governed appropriately by State law and State judges. and the US is a credit ecomony over 70% of our economy is based on consumer spending  which comes mainly from credit extensions and not consumers pay increases), there are simply more defaults, particularly in a Great Recession. Any heavy handed Federal regulation will hamper and restrict credit granting and debt buying, both of which are needed by the economy and the credit industry. While credit grantors should should make their documentation retention systems more accessible and share more documents upon a sale of accounts, a lack of documentation should not hamper State court lawsuits when a debtor offers no dispute so long as the account is adequately identified in a complaint. In Michigan, efforts to "make it more likely that consumers would defend themselves" have fell very flat for the reasons mentioned above. As it has always been, the protections are in place and are used by those debtors that wish to avail themselves of them. Judges are there to listen. However, most debtors (bless them) understand they simply owe the debt.

I do not think that answering 97% of the calls from an automated dialer within two seconds is a solution to my problem. I would like for Mr. Dan to explain exactly what the safeguards of using a robo dialer are. From my perspective as a frequent recipient of robo calls from debt collectors, the problem is a lack of ownership and impersonality of the collection agency when the debt is not assigned to one collector to handle. Years ago when a collector would call me, it would always be the same person. Now it is not. Assign the debt to one collector who would then take full responsibility for making all contacts with the alleged debtor. This could even include acquisition of location information.

What I had in mind when I made this comment was that some debtors are in debt because of a medical condition that has negatively impacted their ability to work. They may be on Social Security disability for this reason. Sometimes, that medical condition is scientifically known to be aggravated by stress, such as any heart condition, or an anxiety disorder. Currently, Section 806 of the FDCPA makes abuse or harassment of debtors illegal. However, what qualifies as abuse might be different for a debtor with a disabling medical condition that is sensitive to stress. My hope, and my suggestion, is that there could be some way for debtors to make collection agencies aware of the fact that the debtor has a documented medical disability, and that abusive or harassing phone calls have additional health consequences for the debtor.

we are bombarded with robo calls every day from early am to late evening with unidentified callers; no msgs left after answering machine kicks in; these types of calls should be barred unless msg left with identity of caller included and basis of call to include name of creditor and debtor included

As someone who has dealt for over two years with a rogue collections company putting a debt I don't owe on my credit report, I think these debt buyers should be disallowed by law. Legitimate third parties can operate, but these fly by night businesses who buy for pennies on the dollar without a care as to whether the books are correct should be fined and put out of business. In other words, the regulations should be so tough that they can't afford to stay open. They only wreak havoc on people. I have dealt with an unscrupulous company for two years; my state Attorney General was involved in getting it removed from my credit report with 1 agency, only to have this company report the same to another agency. No collection should be allowed on the credit report until verified 100%. And if the debt is more than 2 years old, the creditor must notify the supposed debtor in writing and allow 30 days for a response--denial, request for proof, payment, etc.--before putting it on the credit report.

I too am a family member of a consumer who claims to have paid his debt of 12 - 15 years ago, but my husband and I receive two or three calls a day asking for him to call various agencies about a "matter" with a case #.In one instance they said they would be at the door in one hour.This family member has not lived here for about 16 years.They should not be allowed to call anyone other than the debtor who nowadays can be found on the internet!!!

Since the UCC and to the best of my knowledge, State laws do not define reasonable period of time, this is a problem and has been a problem for most lenders and third party collectors based on me experience of over 40 years. Consumers should be able to seek assistance from an attorney and be required to provide the attorney contact information to a collector, unless the attorney has not already. The attorney should be required to notify all creditors of representation within 20 business days of the consumer's signed agreement of that representation. While most attorneys do notify lenders and/or third party agencies some do not and some do not respond to inquiries concerning representation. After the first lender/third party inquiry the attorney should be required to notify the lender and/or agency within 10 business days in writing of representation. The attorney should be required to notify a lender and/or third party within 7 business days that representation of the debtor has been terminated. It should not be a violation for a lender or third party to contact the debtor after 30 days to only determine if the debtor has continued representation of an attorney if there has been no communication provided by the attorney after 30 days of the initial notification in writing of representation. I have experienced no communication after the initial notice by the debtor and/or attorney received over 60-90 days and even six months. If non profit credit counseling agencies can send notification to lenders and third party collectors for representation of a consumer to reduce payments after an initial meeting I believe attorneys should be able to notify in the time periods specified. Setting rules of notification time frames would benefit all parties.

The burden of proof should be on the creditor. If you make the debtor responsible for following up with a request, it gives the creditor an opportunity to say they never received anything from the debtor... If they had to send the documents to start with, there would not be any question.

This so-called "validation notice" might better be called a 'justification notice.' After all, the notification should supply the justification underlying the demand for payment; ("Why am I being asked to pay this money?"). This justification, obviously, should clearly specify the original transaction; i.e., specific product or service purchased, prior efforts to collect, (the history of the collection efforts) and present status. It's not so much 'additional information' which is required, it's more the clarity of the information provided. That said, I'm convinced that communications between creditor and debtor should avoid words like 'creditor' and 'debtor,' along with words like, 'charge-off', 'default' (already mentioned by myself and emmacollector in this thread) and any and all words that belong in an accounting 101 book. I understand what these words signify  and sometimes I get confused by who's the creditor and who's the debtor. Again, simplicity, which entails clarity, ought to be the guiding principle.

As a former bill collector for over 17 years there are alot of ways the industry needs to be cleaned up. I do believe that a debtor should be informed of when a debt is transfered from original creditor to a collector and whether or not that collection agency purchased the debt or if the agency is contracted by the original creditor to collect the debt. There is a big misconception that I see being made in most of these comments that everything is "purchased" which is far from the truth! I personally have not and would not work for an agency that purchased debt, because I know and have heard the horror stories of not only how they treat the debtor but also how the business as a whole treats the collector.

Most companies have a strict "NO PERSONAL CALLS" policy; hence the act should include a clause that "...unless specifically allowed, in writing, by the debtor, a collector is barred from attempting to contact a debtor at his/her place of employment."

It sounds like you believe the creditor/debt collector's attorney should be responsible for giving legal advice to the consumer (i.e. the opposing party). This is a serious conflict of interest and a violation of his duties to his client. Even worse, it sounds like you also want debt collectors who are NOT attorneys or employed by attorneys to also give legal advice to consumers. This is a violation of the prohibition on the unauthorized practice of law. I understand that the ignorance and lack of sophistication exhibited by defendant debtors is a concern. I recommend that the CFPB develop a model notice of rights under the FDCPA. If it so chooses, it can also maintain on its website an area for state-specific resources related to State laws, and reference this website on the form notice.

I think the Massachusetts rule is a positive step in the right direction, and would be better than the current situation. However, for those debtors who truly cannot pay at all, due to a serious adverse life event, such as the loss of a job due to a medical disability, their situation is not likely to change from week to week. For example, most disability insurance companies only require a patient's doctor to submit a re-certification of the patient's medical disability every 3, 6, or 12 months. In essence, the debt collector would be acting as a sort of medical re-certification investigator twice a week, which is unnecessary, burdensome on both debtor and collector, and potentially harassing.

I think the requirement for a debt collector to send a validation notice 5 days after the initial contact is backwards. I believe communication between the debtor and debt collector would be improved if the debtor has the validation notice before the initial telephone contact. The debt collector should be required to mail the debtor a validation notice 5 days before any phone contact, not 5 days after. Otherwise, the debtor is speaking with an unknown caller, who has surprised them with a demand for money. The debtor has not been provided with any time to prepare their thoughts, or to formulate important questions about the alleged debt. They may be caught "off guard", increasing the fear and anxiety of the debtor, which would necessarily lead to impaired verbal communication. The debtor has no written factual statement to refer to during the phone call, while the debt collector has all of the factual details in from of them on their computer screen, and can cite facts and figures. This situation creates an imbalance of power not conducive to good communication. This proposal to require debt collectors to send a validation notice 5 days before the first telephone contact would impose no financial burden on the debt collector,  because validation notices are already required to be sent to the debtor. It is simply a change in the timing of an already existing requirement.

Breaking a promise to pay isn't the same as breaking the law. We can't keep comparing criminal law to civil law  because it's just not the same. But the item that's missing here is the legitimacy of interest. Forget about big banks for a minute,  and think about borrowing money from a friend or neighbor. When you keep money that is rightfully owed to someone else, you damage him, because he doesn't have that money, which he could be investing (to increase it) or spending (to improve his quality of life). That's one of the reasons that interest exists to compensate someone for the loss of their money for a portion of time until it gets repaid. I'm not saying interest rates aren't excessive they certainly are unfortunately, that's a separate issue. But suspending interest all together and allowing a debtor to freeze the amount of his debt indefinitely, because he borrowed more than he could pay back and didn't plan for unexpected expenses.... I don't know anyone who would loan money under those terms, except for maybe Mom and Dad.

I agree that this is about Financial Literacy, However, this is also about the court's enforcing completely one sided credit card adhesion agreements that don't give the debtor/defaulter, rights of any kind, even in the most humanitarian of situations, thereby calling into question the legality of these one sided credit card adhesion agreements. Lets not forget that it was the comptroller of the currency back in 2002 that prevented the Insurance industry from competing in the credit card debt suspension insurance arena with the credit card companies. This allowed the credit card companies to then have an obscene monopoly on overpriced credit card debt suspension insurance premiums they charged their own customers who otherwise could have carried insurance policies that would have frozen interest rate charges for a certain period of time when a life changing emergency occurred. Financial literacy is in play when it comes to the 2% monthly minimum payment addiction scam perpetrated on first time credit card borrowers. 2% monthly minimum payments are literally no different than a crack dealer giving out a few free hits of crack to get people hooked on their product. A person can be buy a $1,000 top of the line television set and only have a 20 or 25 dollar payment due the next month. That's credit card crack in my opinion. Financial Literacy could be a warning printed in bold letters on every credit card agreement warning how credit cards purposely have low monthly minimum payments to lure one into more and more debt, how credit card companies have no compassion for life changing events, and that credit card companies are overcharging for credit card debt suspension insurance by a factor of up to 2,000%. Put those three warnings on every agreement in bold letters,  and two things happen, customers have a better chance of becoming financially literate,  and it also is an admission of fraud by the credit card companies for all the prior agreements already in place. So the irony is the credit card companies can't change even if they wanted to. But where is the outside force to come from to make the obvious happen in regards to those three credit card wanrings? Apparently it can't come from the CFPB,  which is unfortunate  because it turn this ties the courts hands that much more.

In order to get a default judgment through a State Court, a collector's pleadings have to spell out the theory of their case (usually contract) with sufficient specificity that a reasonable person can understand the basis for the claim. Without some form of affidavit from the actual creditor, very few courts will award a default judgment. Also, most state court approved forms are already written for the "least sophisticated debtor." I don't see any reason to impose a more stringent standard on collection lawsuits than are imposed on any other lawsuit.

I was receiving 4 or 5 calls a day from Midland Debt Collection daily for two weeks on my cellphone. As I'm unemployed and scraping by I was ignoring - or rather trying to ignore - the calls. They were always hang-ups. Never any message. As I live in Indiana - a "business-oriented" state,  it seems the laws favor the debt collectors over the debtors. Limits on calls? Please, do. When I finally did have the gumption to answer when they called at 8:10am on a Sunday morning, I made a strong case about being harrassed and informed him I didn't want to be contacted on my cell phone. It's only a few days but I'll see. I still don't know if it was any legit debt that they were calling about.

I would like to see a rule prohibiting debt collectors, debt owners/debt buyers, and other related affiliates from being able to pull a debtor"s credit report once the debt is officially time-barred and out of SOL. I would also like there to be a rule that specifically distinguishes between a "hard pull" and a "soft pull" credit inquiry. I have been opted out of promotional marketing via the __URL__ website for years. I do not have debt and have never had debt. What I do have is a common name,  and so from time to time I will have various debt collectors and debt buyers "soft pulling" my credit reports while they are trying to locate whomever they are trying to locate. This should not be allowed even if the debt is still collectable and within the SOL. No debt collector has a "permissible purpose" to just randomly "soft pull" my credit reports just because I have a common name. As far as being outside the SOL and time-barred debts: no debt collector and debt owners/debt buyers should be allowed to pull someone"s credit report  since they can't legally sue the debtor outside of the SOL. So there is no need to continue pulling someone"s credit report. As far as the "hard pull" "soft pull" is concerned: There needs to be specific language that prohibits any debt collectors, debt owners/debt buyers, and other related affiliates from performing "hard pull" credit report inquiries. The FCRA makes it clear what "permissible purposes" are  but it does not specifically state or distinguish between a "hard pull" and a "soft pull" credit inquiry. A "hard pull" is a consumer-initiated request for an extension of credit. Anything other than a consumer-initiated request is a "soft pull." But time and time again, I have friends, family members, and online forum members, tell me and show me that a debt collector or a debt owner/debt buyer has "hard pulled" their credit report. And some of these times are when the debt is time-barred from being outside the SOL and also from the Credit Reporting Time Period. This is unacceptable. A "hard pull" will decrease a consumers credit score and will be visible for up to 25 months to anyone who does have a legitimate permissible purpose to view that consumer"s credit report Making a "hard pull" on a debtor"s credit report could be a violation of the FDCPA in the privacy of the debtor. Any debt collectors, debt owners/debt buyers, and other related affiliates should be prohibited from doing "hard pulls"  and the CFPB should make it absolutely clear. www.optoutprescreen.com __URL__

Let's remember that most debtors have had the original creditor from 2 to 4 collection agencies and the creditors attorneys office before a suit is ever filed. That process usually takes as much a 2 years or more. So it is difficult to think that the courts should make special accommodations for these individuals. Every person called into court has had many opportunities to have the debt validated or payment arrangements made prior to a default judgment. I do believe basic evidence should be supplied. This would be a statement or bill copy with a matching name of the consumer and proof of address at the time the debt was incurred. This proof of address could be provided by other confirming data available through skip tracing companies. There were significant problems with how debt buyers were allowed to file suit and receive default judgments with virtually no evidence. So improvements and consistency is needed in evidence but it should also not be expected to show every single bill copy.

Someone keeps calling for a person named Sean, who does not live here and I don't know anyone by that name. I tell them they have the wrong number, but they continue to call. They sometimes leave canned messages on my answering machine. I realize some debtors pretend not to be at the number being called,  but these collectors need to verify the information  so they don't keep calling the wrong number. I don't know if the debtor gave the wrong number intentionally, or this number was used by someone else before I got it. It is extremely irritating. And even though the callers do not say they are debt collectors, it is obvious.

The Michigan program for handling NSF checks is outlined in Michigan statute (MCL 600.2952). The statute provides the exact language to be used in the demand notice to the debtor but does not include the FDCPA Miranda language- which we add to the notice. We also send a copy of the dishonored check with the notice. The statute allows the debtor to pay the value of the check plus $25 is paid within 30 days of the notice, or $35 if paid thereafter. IF the creditor brings suit (after the first 30 days) they can sue for the value of the check, PLUS damages of 2 times the amount of the dishonored check PLUS $250 in costs. This may even be used in small claims court. It seems that the idea is to penalize those who pass bad checks such that merchants will be willing to accept checks from customers.

Providing too much information in the first notice creates a risk of divulging sensitive personal information to the person who now lives where the actual debtor used to. I do think that providing the chain of ownership information (especially original creditor) should be provided for sold debts. When it comes to medical debts, HIPPA becomes another concern. Therefore, specific info on medical debts should only be provided AFTER the collector has verified that they are communicating with the proper party.

The current validation notice is already too long--bordering on "boilerplate". To add more language to this would confuse or intimidate the least sophisticated debtor and/or lead them to immediately ask that the creditor cease communication. The problem with that strategy is that it forces the creditor to file suit, thereby incurring court costs that will be added to the debt. Instead, debtors should be encouraged to communicate their questions & concerns to the collector who can then (after right-party verification) openly discuss the account & quite possibly answer the debtor's question(s).

We instruct our collectors to treat EVERY dispute the same--whether received in writing or over the phone and without regard to when it was received. Therefore, I agree that debtors should provide the information referenced in FCRA. The problem with FCRA disputes is the E-Oscar system that only affords the collector a couple options like "account information is accurate as of date reported"" this doesn't even make sense as a response to the info provided by the debtor. If E-Oscar is going to be a valid "dispute" under FDCPA, that website needs some serious updating including making sure that disputes actually contain the information listed in CFR 1022.43(d) and allowing collectors to transmit the actual contract/itemized statements/etc back to the debtor.

Any FTC rule regarding verification should absolutely include an exception for frivolous and irrelevant disputes because there are way too many websites out there providing sample dispute letters and the advice to keep using them that the process is abused by enough debtors that we now have a standard letter to address this issue.

The CFPB should clarify whether "verify" means verify that you are a legitimate collection agency (not a scam) OR does it mean to prove the legitimacy of the account relative to the debtor's objections. If is the former, some basic information relative to the account--contract, itemized statements, or any other identifying information that only the creditor would have access to would suffice. If CFPB wants "verify" to answer every single objection a debtor can cook up, a collector could never move forward without spending hundreds of hours normally reserved for litigation. As to a time frame on answering, I think the current system of stopping collection action until verification is provided is appropriate. Normally, sending the information to the debtor is not the hard part. Getting the info from the creditor and then circling back around to this particular account is what takes the time. I don't think disputes should be limited to the first 30 days, but should be prohibited once suit has been filed. The Court rules and discovery process provide the debtor all the access to this information they could ever need or want and the provide this access under pretty strict penalties from the Court if the creditor/plaintiff does not provide the info requested.

I have a hard time believing that a debt collection company "treat[s] EVERY dispute the same" when debt collectors seem to blatantly disregard a dispute that has the appearance of being "copied directly from the internet." Consumer advocates are trying to educate consumers, debtors, and alleged debtors with information on how to handle debt collectors or how to handle their particular situation. We are try to give them relevant links to FDCPA, FCRA, HIPPA, and various form letters that can help them communicate with debt collectors. There is nothing wrong with form letters. But there is everything wrong with debt collectors disregaring certain letters just because they don't like that it came from a consumer advocate source. Debt collectors operating legally and with nothing to hide should never treat form letters as something to throw in the trash. You seem to be saying that debt collectors will only want to communicate with consumers who are misinformed and don't know what their rights are, rather than communicate with a consumer who knows the laws and the appropriate ways to address a letter of dispute.

If our client(s) can't provide any verification of the debt, we close the account and send the debtor a letter that we are doing so. Note: this has only happened once or twice in 20 years. an unresolved dispute account should NOT be sold. If so, seller should be liable.

The problem is not with a form letter of dispute. The problem is that these websites and unreasonable letters lead unsophisticated debtors to believe that a creditor has to provide extraordinary proof that simply is not required. 'stopwithspoofedcallerID' (if that IS your real name) is correct that no legitimate dispute should be ignored, regardless of the form, but nor should debtors be allowed to abuse the system by repeatedly asking for proofs that are not required.

I think the "unless" part of the rule about contacting a person more than once should be scrapped. They should not be allowed to contact anyone (other than the debtor him/herself) more than once. If the person (usually the innocent family member) they contact to try to locate the debtor is willing to give out contact info, fine. If not, whether they have it or not is beside the point. They should not be forced in the middle. It is not their debt, or in any way their responsibility. And when collectors claim they can't give their name or a return phone number to be passed on because of privacy reasons, how can they expect someone else to share personal contact info with a stranger?

The agency I work for is small and follows FDCPA to the letter of the law. And yet we are still sued constantly by attorneys representing debtors. These attorneys count on the fact that it's less costly to settle than to go to court to prove that we have not violated the law. Our retail division is in trouble because we've recently lost our two largest clients -- for this reason. They're now getting slapped with bogus lawsuits as well. People don't even have to pay their bills any more; they just send a "cease and desist" letter, hire an attorney, and wait for a settlement to roll in. All this will lead to are more stringent rules around extending credit, which is not a good thing for the economy. If we keep going down this slope, the only people who will be able to get credit will be those who don't need it.

This is a fantastic idea. Right now, debt buyers buy debt for an average price of 4 cents on the dollar. Many debts are bought for 2-4 cents on the dollar and many other debts are given away for free. If I were an original creditor, would like to get the most money I could for a debt owed to me. And so if I could get 10 cents on the dollar directly from the debtor, rather than 4 cents on the dollar from a debt buyer, then I would see no reason not to offer a significantly reduced debt settlement rate to the debtor (or as you call it, letting consumers bid on their own debt). Right now, original creditors offer no significant reduced rate to debtor before selling for 4 cents on the dollar. Most creditors barely even offer debtors 10% off the debt as a settlement offer. Sure, a creditor could more quickly offload portfolios to debt buyers by selling them at 4 cents on the dollar. But creditors could also make way more money offering a onetime chance at 10 cents on the dollar (or something really attractive but still more than 4 cents on the dollar). Perhaps the CFPB should make a rule that allows consumers/debtors the chance to receive a onetime offer that is valid for only X amount of days (maybe 45 days) from the date of the letter sent from their creditors of a significantly reduced rate. The offer would only be valid for a short amount of time and would also inform the consumer that, should the consumer not accept the offer, the creditor would then turn it over to a debt buyer. This letter would only be sent if the creditor"s intentions are to sell the debt and not just another attempt to collect. So that this way it gives the consumer one final chance to clear the debt owed and the creditors also have less loss and more profits and would be able to lend to more consumers, give better rates to consumers, and stimulate the economy. Because more money that is changing hands at higher values (10 cents on the dollar vs. 4 cents on the dollar) instead of sitting in the accounts receivable section waiting to be collected (one day, if ever) stimulates the economy. This rule would not negatively impact anything (or anyone) and only positively impacts everyone. One minor impact might be on the debt collection industry possibly receiving less debt in their portfolios that they buy, but this minor impact is offset by the large positive impacts on the economy.

Yes. I fell onto hard times during a divorce and found out a few years ago that my dad (whom I haven't lived with for 20+ years) receives so many debt collection calls for me every day he quit answering his home phone. This is unacceptable. We cannot even figure out how they got his phone number because I never lived at that address at any point while I had those credit cards and he never co-signed any loans or credit cards with me. The only connection we can come up with is that my stepmom co-signed a short term furniture loan for me 20 years ago when I was just out of college and that maybe somehow her name is tied to my credit report in some way although I've never seen it on my credit reports. This is now 6 years after I went through my divorce  and he told me a few months ago he still gets several calls per week for me from debt collectors. Personally, I don't think they should be allowed to call ANY number for more than 3 months without successful contact with the debtor. Clearly, they don't have proof they've got the right number  and all they're doing by calling the same unverified number for 6 years is harrassing an innocent party.

I guess I should also have clarified in my previous comment that I have made attempts to deal with creditors directly if I know who they are and who they claim to be representing but my personal perception is they PREFER to continue contacting 3rd parties because they hope I'll just pay them to avoid the public humiliation. And in regards to a comment I read here that creditors can call a 3rd party again if they have a reasonable belief that the person knows how to contact the debtor, I disagree with that entirely. First of all, I'm not aware of any law that compels a 3rd party to provide current contact information for a debtor, so even if they do know where that debtor is, they don't deserve to be harassed daily for months or years as punishment for not offering up that information. Many people don't want to be involved and no law that I know of says they have to if they aren't a party to the debt. Secondly, there is no clear and concise way I know of that a creditor can prove what was a reasonable belief. My in-laws have no idea how to reach my sister-in-law because she wants it that way. They haven't spoken in 3 years and I don't see that changing. You can't assume that certain relatives MUST know where a debtor is.

This is an awesome suggestion! Your suggestion "I don't think they should be allowed to call ANY number for more than 3 months without successful contact with the debtor" is spot on! And I can't believe that no one else has ever suggested this before. 3 months (or whatever an appropriate time limit is) would reduce the constant harassment that I and many other innocent parties receive. This morning I received an illegal phone call from a collector at 6:17 AM with a spoofed phone number for a person that I have never known and I have told these collectors this several times already. They have the wrong number. And I am tired of this. The CFPB should absolutely implement a rule that forces unsuccessful contact to 3 months.

As a college grad since 1979 and a first-time homebuyer, I have found widespread violations of the FDCPA among the creditors and their outsourced private collections agencies. I've also found and been a victim of deception in the debt collection practice observing poor record keeping on the part of all parties. We must first examine debt collection from a derivative and forensic viewpoint; corporate finance, federally/state funded institutions and their debt obligations. GAAP allows for the write-off of old debts. Yet and still the creditors outsource collection agencies to collect debts the creditor has written off of their balance sheet. The debtor is always subject to the debt because the collection agency takes a percentage Then comes the finance charge (interest) and late payment charges. In essence, the original debt remains the same because the debtor is only paying commission, interest and late charges. I attended a Texas private college (state funded) that lost its accreditation for mismanagement of funds. My financial aid consisted of the BEOG, NDSL, Stafford Loan and the Merit Scholarship. The school policy was to clear the balance of my bill before my grades were released. Each grade period, whatever the balance was, my Mom used the funds she had left from our Social Security Income (father deceased 1972) after paying monthly expenses to send to me for my grades to be released. After my marriage, the Dept of Ed (Higher Ed) offset two years of joint tax returns, private collection agencies constantly called. When I was employed, I voluntarily paid $50/mo. for two years on this debt of which the principle was $4,650. Even after over 30 yrs., the debt was recorded as a Federal Abstract of Judgement at the county registrar (filed by private attorneys) as if I still owe the debt. I wasn't properly served. The process server (whomever it was) left a large manila envelope. Now the debt has been turned over to the Dept. of Justice in the State of Michigan. My point is that there is a widespread conflict of interest among the creditor and those outsourced by the creditor for debt collection. Most, if not all of these organizations are operated by taxpayer funding. The taxpayers are the ultimate creditors.

Technology does not allow debtors or alleged debtors to distinguish land lines from cellphones of debt collectors; whether private or federal. There appears to be a double standard between the debtor and collector. I have received calls after business hours and sometimes even on a Sunday from a mortgage servicer, whom I will not disclose. This particular servicer has even left an anonymous type of flyer (one that can be hung on a doorknob) with instructions to call the specific servicer's customer service phone number; without disclosing the name of the servicer, although I was already familiar with the phone number. I would classify this as mail fraud because it bypassed the mail system. The same scenario with the service of process regarding my old school loan. The service of process bypassed the mail system These are both issues that should be resolved collectively by and among the FCC, FTC and DOJ (not all inclusive). A debt collector can call the debtor from a phone number outside of the collector's company so it won't be included in the company's phone log. If the debtor attempts to return the phone call, the number is either inoperable or not able to receive incoming calls. Collectors may even call a debtor in order to attempt them to give personal information about lowering the interest rate on their credit card (even if the debtor doesn't have a credit card). It is obvious or apparent that there may be a credit card floating around in the debtor's name unknowingly. These are all scenarios I have experienced. We haven't gotten to the subject of sharing a debtor's information among the debtor's financial institution and the financial institution's correspondent institutions and investment advisor affiliates and other business combinations of the debtor (public utilities companies, mortgage servicers, insurance companies, pension fund mgrs, etc...

There is no need for these so-called examiners but there is definitely a need for courageous and dedicated attorneys determined to enforce the laws that the CFPB should pass, laws that protect the ordinary folk, the innocent, those who're unable to protect themselves, even those who may have actually failed to pay their bills because our constitution guarantees the right to our innocence unless proven guilty. We cannot allow expediency to deny us such fundamental rights. I believe there is such a thing as the Gideon Decision by the Supreme Court that provides for any accused to an adequate defence, so if any debt-collector or creditor for that matter denies the alleged debtor the right to have his day in court or to a proper defence, then the CFPB attorneys should come down hard on such violators. The principle behind any rules promulgated by the CFPB must ensure that no alleged debtor get bullied into paying up or blind-sided by the court into doing so. Sometimes, there are reasons why the outstanding bills are not paid  and the consumer should be allowed to confront the creditor to resolve any complaints by the consumer before the bills are paid. It's a very straight-forward and simple situation actually. All the CFB needs to do is to enact basic regulations that protects the consumer and stipulates very clearly that the burden of proof must be borne by the creditor before any debt-collector can be engaged to pursue such debts. The debt-collector must only be allowed to follow specific guidelines when doing so and the matter should be referred to a small claims court to have both sides plead their case before the court issues a ruling, rather than to allow the claim to be reported to a credit reporting agency  that will destroy the credit score or rating of the consumer without his knowledge, which is absolutely wrong. Only lawful and valid debts, i.e. when a judgment order has been made, should be allowed to be reported to any credit reporting agency, to avoid creditors and debt-collectors from using such agencies to damage the interests of alleged debtors with unfounded or unproven debts.

As medical records become more digitized, I see no significant cost increase to debt collectors in passing on substantive info to debtors,although debt collectors are bound to say otherwise.My concern is that the cost to consumers of inadequate information is routinely underestimated or dismissed as trivial.When I worked with a non-profit in Alabama, I took part in an informational meeting on a program of federal assistance (Farmers Home Admin, IIRC) in securing access to home loans on affordable terms for low-income workers.One woman who was at the meeting spoke of having been denied access to the program because of a single blot on her credit record, namely an unpaid medical bill.She said she had not paid it because she could not determine what the charges were for, was unaware of any medical treatment she had not paid for, and could not get a straight answer from the debt collector.She decided the debt might be illegitimate and refused to pay.As a result she was excluded from access to a home loan.This is an example of a consumer on a limited income who was consistently disciplined about her finances and who should have had access to credit.I find it significant that it was a medical bill that tripped her up, placing her in a category in which even the FHA would not work with her.From this point, credit was only available to her at high cost if at all.I am confident that the rule I am suggesting would have led her to either pay the debt or dispute it formally on the basis of valid information.What it would not have done is to leave her to conclude that she was being scammed and refuse to pay at all.This anecdote (and I admit I only have anecdotal evidence) does suggest that legitimate credit agencies also stand to benefit by disclosing information that will persuade skeptical consumers that they do actually owe the debt.

When calling about a debt, debt collectors MUST verify that they are speaking to the debtor(s) or other adult within the household. I know that is stated within the FDCPA but from experience I know it doesn't always happen. My situation goes back to the 1970's but it was done then  and it's probably still being done today. Calling repeatedly, threatening, screaming, cursing at children gets collectors absolutely nowhere. It is a most disgusting form of abuse that should never be tolerated. New language in the FDCPA should specifically and clearly state this. Additionally, there should be some form of penalty for collectors who engage in this demeaning and useless practice.

I have not encountered a situation in which the bill collector is hired by a business for many decades now. Usually the debt collector has bought the debt, usually for pennies on the dollar, from the original creditor. I also disagree that the law provides a way for consumers to steal from businesses. If anything, I would say we have become in danger of reverting to the tyranny of Dickens' time, where a person and that person's family, including children, would be imprisoned for debt. Surely we can agree on reasonableness when it comes to how we treat each other, whether debtor or creditor?

I agree with MER. I have experience as a debtor, pro-bono attorney and debt collector. You can't expect collectors to be judge or jury. The cease communication right is meant to to force the collector to sue or go away.

Honest, respectful and open communication between consumers and collectors should be the goal. If there are too many roadblocks to making contact with a debtor, more consumers will find negative information on their credit reports and have more lawsuits filed against them. Rule number 1 strikes the right balance. If the consumer responds, the consumer will receive the mini-miranda disclosure and information about the debt. If the named person is not at the number, is it really so awful to call the collector and let them know? If calls contiue after that point from the same collector, then there should be penalties. Professional collectors do not want to waste time calling a wrong number.

They will just continue to call. Not answering does not stop the constant calls. They need to be required to identify themselves accurately  so the consumer has at least a fighting chance to speak with them. In my case I have no debts of my own but am constantly harassed for other people's debts  because I have a fairly common last name. They just start calling everyone with the same last name as their actual debtor.

After a court verdict in favor of a debt collector, Banks assess a significant fee against a customer when a customer's account is levied by the debt collector , even if there are scant funds in the account on the day the levy is imposed. Explain how assessing a 125 dollar bank levy fee when an account has 50 dollars in it helps resolve the ongoing debt resolution. The Debt collector gets nothing and the customer is hit with a 125 dollar bank levy fee. Why isn't there a 100 dollar float that is impervious to a bank levy fee and protected from the debt collector's clutches as well? Once again, we get back to the same underpinning, Judges who simply decide on whether a default has occurred without caring why the default occurred are basically rubber stamping minions of a system corrupted by a lack of fairness. People can lose income based on circumstances beyond their control, yet the system doesn't even blanche an eye. A debtor who purposely runs up debt quickly and defaults is treated identically to someone who had a perfect payment history but had to stop working to become a CareGiver for a family member. A debtor who purposely runs up debt quickly and hires a lawyer can strategically default and possibly get a better resolution than an honest person with an impeccable payment history who has lost income because of an event beyond their control.

There needs to be a universal Statute of Limitations. The current system is an absolute mess. 17 states maintain a SOL of three to four years, while 19 others have the six years SOL time limit. The rest all have diverse SOL limits with some extending for even up to 10 years. Tolling provisions make it even more confusing. Simplify it. Have a single NATIONAL Statute of Limitations. Make it fair for everyone (debt collectors and debtors 5 years seems reasonable. Having a universal Statute of Limitations will eliminate confusion and ambiguity as to when and where a debtor can be sued.

I believe that a universal statute of limitations would be an effective way to end debt tolling. If there was a universal statute of limitations, there would be no need for debt tolling. Collectors would be able to file suit no matter where the debtor lived based on a single set of federal laws. It also makes things less confusing for debtors  (they know that they can be sued within X amount of years no matter where they go, hence they can't "run" from debt and debt collectors don't have to go from state to state, wading through murky laws. Furthermore, debt collectors should not have the privilege of hiding behind tolling laws. Either they sue or they don't within a federally mandated set of time. Tolling simply keeps zombie debt going and going.

There are a few states that have the barbaric practice of actually arresting people for their debts by using a legal loophole. Some of the most egregious examples are in Minnesota, Illinois, and Missouri. The creditor sues the debtor in court. If the person fails to show, a warrant can be issued for their arrest. The police can actually arrest and jail the debtor until a court hearing, or until they pay the bond (which is usually the amount of the debt). This is a downright abuse of the legal system. These loopholes need to be closed in all states.

I've heard multiple stories of summons being dropped off or served to the wrong individual and summons being mailed to old addresses when the new address was clearly available. I don't believe that a summons should ever be served by mail.  If the debt collector wants to sue, they should be required to serve the person directly in the city and state in which they currently reside. It's an especially dirty tactic to serve someone by mail. It's unreliable and puts the debtor at a disadvantage.

Notification that a debt is being sold would be ideal as it would afford the debtor the opportunity to negotiate the amount and possibly assist in thwarting any potential negative reporting on one's credit report.If a debtor is afforded the opportunity to negotiate his or her debt for a reasonable amount, perhaps the selling and reselling of debt may be marginalized.More and more consumers have emails and other modes of communicationand therefore, it would be in the best interest of all parties to amicably resolve issues.However, should the dispute not be quelled, reasonable arrangements should be afforded to the debtor.Debts as assets is an outrageous concept and it behooves both the debtor and the creditor to "work-it-out".That is in the best interest of all.It begins with information, communication and resolution.

I appreciate Mr. Bartmann's comments but they appear to be grounded in a collection agency perspective  (there is always business and market share tension between collection agencies and law firms). The reality is that (and this was voiced by other participants) many (not all but many) debtors simply won't/can't pay until they have to. The FDCPA and TCPA have truly made communications with debtor both difficult and hazardous for the collector. For instance, the fact that you can't safely leave a voice message for a debtor should be very troubling. Over the years, our firm has stopped initial outbound calling (responding only to inbound calls) and also limited our pre-suit letters to just two. We send the required disclosure letter and (there being no response and the account reviewed for suit) then send a discounted payment offer that says we are going to file suit but would rather settle. We offer reasonable terms to the debtors to avoid a costly suit but  the response rate is absolutely miserable, probably in the single digits percentage wise. Believe me, suits are time consuming and expensive,  but they are often simply the only option. Even when the debtors are served, few contact us, and even fewer when the court sends them the judgment. Worse, a judgment doesn't guarantee payment on the account. Clarification via Regulations as to what we can say and do in communications would at least promote more communication between the parties. With that, perhaps more points of contact could resolve debts before suit. I strongly disagree that litigation should be "discouraged" as it is not only a simple reality in much of debt collection but a fundamental right of a creditor. However, I think Regulations making it clear what can and cannot be done in communications that can shield the industry from the wild west of FDCPA and TCPA lawsuits would greatly encourage more communication. I also think a reasonable, good faith attempt to resolve the case (offering a payment plan and/or lump sum) before suit is filed is still a good idea as well  even though our own response rate has not been great. Anything more will infringe on a creditor's rights and interfere with state law. Perhaps the CFPB Portal could have a debt resolution aspect to it where a debtor could try to resolve an account in a "safer" more disarming manner.

This is the PROBLEM over and over Why should lawyers get a pass from rules of the Bar Associations or rules of the court because they are now considered "debt collectors" even I did not know this, though I have seen advertised quite a bit lawyers in the "collection" business. This is wrong. I hope if anything, this very thing is addressed. Using a lawyer to send a letter is often a way to intimidate. People become too frightened to even respond. The rules are blown off by lawyers who go into this debt collection business  because they make a fast easy buck, and they know the debtor has very little recourse, and there is so few rules that protect the consumer/debtor. Being in debt stopped being a crime decades ago, but the lack of rules that protect the debtor are bringing back these draconian practices. Uniformity, is needed, and making lawyers abide by the rules of the Bar. Just two right off. It is bringing to light why this system has become so fraught with abuse.

I agree with you that being in debt is not a crime, however, if a debtor defaults on a debt they basically have no rights if they cannot afford an attorney  as one will not be provided for them by the state. Pro Se can easily become a mess  as no one will actually help with the paperwork,  even state funded pro se agencies are simply paid to show where to get the right papers, not to fill them out.

Because credit card contracts are adhesion contracts, it is up to educated third party observers to make sure the adhesion contract is fair. If a person experiences a dramatic event beyond their control that reduces their income, it seems questionable to not allow the debtor the right to suspend the interest rate charges, penalties and fees until they have regained their income. They are still promising to pay, but since their life has been turned upside down by an event beyond their control,  that should have standing in some cases. It just doesn't seem ethical to punish a consumer  because their home washes down the river one day, or is burned to the ground by a wild fire, destroyed in an earthquake, and so on. It especially does not seem ethical that the credit card companies are allowed to hide how they will punish a consumer if the consumer's intent was always to make their payments and it took an act of God to prevent that from happening. Insurance policies do not cover acts of war,  yet our own government allowed the owner of the twin towers to collect on their insurance policy  even though 911 was clearly an act of war. I believe there have been polls that show a majority of americans are upset because the 2008 bailouts did not give them any respite of any kind. The "Promise to Pay" says nothing about making that payment every month above and beyond all other situations and scenarios. I believe judges have misinterpreted Promise to Pay and that lawyers like the way it is set up now  so they don't want to challenge the obvious holes in credit card adhesion contracts because it could quash their own future income stream.

I would disagree that there is confusion among consumers about SOL which would, as you suggest, require the need for a national SOL. The only time I have personally seen SOL straddle a line is when a consumer moves to another state with a different SOL. The clarity needs to be in these such cases. Because once a debtor moves, both parties claim the SOL where it benefits them for their desired outcome. A national SOL only benefits the debt collectors and not the consumers. The focus should remain on creating, as best as possible, a win-win solution that benefits the debt collectors the consumers. Having a national SOL of 7 years as ACA International wants compromises state laws wherein some states of SOL of 3 years (and otherwise less than 7). A SOL is meant to bring resolve. And in reality, if a debt collector/debt owner can not resolve their clients issues within the already established SOL of each state, then extending the SOL or having a national SOL under which to bring suit does nothing but allow debt collectors to continue to harass consumers. Three years really is more than enough time to sue. Just as criminal defendants are entitled to a quick and speedy trail, so should consumers who may/may not be aware they have an outstanding debt. That is to say: having a national SOL is a guise to prolong resolution rather than a more quick a final resolve in when to bring suit.




emmacollector

This so-called "validation notice" might better be called a 'justification notice.' After all, the notification should supply the justification underlying the demand for payment; ("Why am I being asked to pay this money?"). This justification, obviously, should clearly specify the original transaction; i.e., specific product or service purchased, prior efforts to collect, (the history of the collection efforts) and present status. It's not so much 'additional information' which is required, it's more the clarity of the information provided. That said, I'm convinced that communications between creditor and debtor should avoid words like 'creditor' and 'debtor,' along with words like, 'charge-off', 'default' (already mentioned by myself and emmacollector in this thread) and any and all words that belong in an accounting 101 book. I understand what these words signify  and sometimes I get confused by who's the creditor and who's the debtor. Again, simplicity, which entails clarity, ought to be the guiding principle.




endore

I strongly endore drose977's response. Currently, debt collection agencies can sell debt without proper validation. Or they can sell the debt if a consumer disputes the debt and the agency can't product the proper validation. These things should not be allowed and are very detrimental to the consumer. Consumers should be protected above collectors and other agencies as they, typically, have far less resources to fight inaccurate information. Additionally, the inaccurate information adversely effects consumers more than any other group in these situations. Collectors should not be allowed to report a debt as 30 days late if the debt isn't 30 days late. The law should include stiff enforcable penalities to deter collectors from pre-dating debt. These rules should apply for any debt reported late at any time, not just the first 30 days.




eoscar

I believe reasonable will depend on the circumstance of the dispute and the type of debt. A formal checklist should be created for various scenarios  and the analyst reviewing the dispute should be able to enter comments against the checklist which would be part of the eoscar transcript.




etcand

Many disputes are difficult to investigate because it is unclear what the consumer's dispute actually is.If the consumer is specific enough so that there is a clear item to research, we will do so.However, its a vague dispute such as "I dispute this debt" or "I don't owe this debt" (which is incredibly common), then we will provide statements or a contract to attempt to address it.The amount of the investigation is largely lead by the amount of detail the consumer relays,and most of it results in us relying on the documentation the creditor provides to resolve the dispute.Sometimes we may need to ask the creditor to research their records for indication of X, Y, or Z,but most the time the dispute isn't that specific.I find in my practice that we will often ask a consumer to provide information to support their dispute (such as proof of payment), but then the consumer does not provide it, and we are stuck in our efforts to investigate further.Requiring only a "reasonable" investigation without further definition sounds like a punt to the courts to decide the defintion after a lot of litigation.I think at least a broad definition of obtaining documentation to support the position that consumer owes the debt/amount/and creditor is a good place to start.I would love to see consumers use a form letter prepared by the CFPB which spells out a variety of disputes and helps them articulate the dispute better.I do think one of the toughest hurdles for a collector (and one of the biggest complaints from persons against whom collection efforts are made) is when they get a person that states the debt is not theirs (but someone else's ) with the same name.We do our homework on our end to investigate (we'll attempt to compare the last 4 digits of the social, we may run a skip trace to see if party we contacted lived at the address on the statements, etcand we will provide verification,but in a mobile world investigating that the John Smith you contacted is the same John Smith you are attempting to resolve a debt with can prove tricky.This is especially tricky if there is NEVER indication that we have reached the wrong person.We never wish to contact the wrong party regarding a debt,but it unfortunately happens because consumers don't always relay updated contacted information to creditors and a collector then has to rely upon the best information available to them.Unfortunately, I don't know what the fix is here.Despite the stories to the contrary, it simply is not the intent of any professional and responsible collection agency or firm to attempt collections from a party that does not owe the debt,but this is a hard one to address without good communication from the wrongly contacted party and the collector.




explointing

It apprears that the debt collectors of the debt collection industry are conducting a money laundry and racketing operation by explointing and obtaining monetary from comsumers for products that they don't sell to them or services that they don't provide to consumers with no inital purchase contract with consumers. It appears that debt collectors are obtaining monetary from consumers where they don't have licenses to sell products to consumers or provide services to consumers. It appears that debt collectors are costing companies money when companies are trying to recover their loses when they miss payments from their customers for the products that they sell to their customers or the services that they provide to their customers with alegal purchase contracts. It seems that debt collector are relying on companies' money and on consumers' money for an income when they are not initially involved in the a company sale of products to consumers or in the distributing of a company of services to a consumers.




guraranteed

I was a reference for an ex-boyfriend on a student loan application. One of the FDCPA rules is that the reference can only be contacted once by a creditor. Well, each time the account is sold to a new collection agency, they call me again, even though I tell them I have no idea where he is. I think creditors skirt the FDCPA regulations in a manner that harasses consumers. For any given account, the reference should only be able to be called a set amount of times--such as the first three collection agencies to purchase the debt from the original creditor. Here it is, almost 9 years later, and I am still getting calls for a person who is now a stranger to me. Since it is a student loan, it could go on forever. There is no statute of limitations for government guraranteed debt that I am aware of...




impicitly

I assume by "free to end" you meant the agency is on the hook for the charges incurred on that particular call. I think it would be well worth exploring. We do have situations where the consumer doesnt have a landline and refuses access to their cell. If we recieve a cease and desist order we note the account and return it to our client as such. If a consumer simply asks not to be contacted via cell we will remove the cell and send a collection letter if it is within FDCPA guidelines. Other solutions may be to send a settlement letter allowing the consumer to save money in an effort to resolve the issue. The industry certainly didn't set a very good standard  and regulation is certainly needed. I think the vast majotiry of us get the message loud and clear and are making sure we comply impicitly. The effort needs to be two fold. The consumers have to be willing to discuss the accounts and express willingness to pay. After all, if everyone's debts were paid, there would be no need for a call. And that's not meant to sound standoffish. The simple fact remains at the end of the day, debts are owed and our clients want their money. Consumers must share some of the responsibility.




incurracately

my in-laws had the same issue with BoA. They paid their mortgate EARLY every month and still were reported as late every month. This is tragic and ruined their credit. When these things happen it takes years for the credit to br repaired even though a collector reported the information falsely, incurracately, and repeatedly. BoA should be penalized HEAVILY for these infractions otherwise they just ignore consumers.




iscovery

I have already spoken with an attorney. This is how I found out about the separation of state and federal law. Because I was sued in state civil court is why my validation requests were ignored by the plaintiffs as well as the seating judge. What I should have done (in state court) was sent a 'discovery' request AFTER the case had been filed rather then a validation request. Please note - the 'collection agency' was a large legal firm. They knew the laws well and whereas I was a lay person and not versed in law , I was like a sitting duck just waiting for the slaughter. If I did take them to court I would receive hundreds but it would cost me thousands.... and I just do not have that type of money. What really touched my heart was sitting in that court room and seeing others that also thought that the law would be fair if they represented themselves. Needless to say, we all lost and lost big time. I asked the judge why would he allow this when the plaintiff was a unlicensed collection agency and he stated ' they look like attorneys to me'. I knew that at that point I had lost my case.

The CFPB should clarify whether "verify" means verify that you are a legitimate collection agency (not a scam) OR does it mean to prove the legitimacy of the account relative to the debtor's objections. If is the former, some basic information relative to the account--contract, itemized statements, or any other identifying information that only the creditor would have access to would suffice. If CFPB wants "verify" to answer every single objection a debtor can cook up, a collector could never move forward without spending hundreds of hours normally reserved for litigation. As to a time frame on answering, I think the current system of stopping collection action until verification is provided is appropriate. Normally, sending the information to the debtor is not the hard part. Getting the info from the creditor and then circling back around to this particular account is what takes the time. I don't think disputes should be limited to the first 30 days, but should be prohibited once suit has been filed. The Court rules and discovery process provide the debtor all the access to this information they could ever need or want and the provide this access under pretty strict penalties from the Court if the creditor/plaintiff does not provide the info requested.




iunsurance

I have had several doctor/laboratory debts placed on my credit report. These are debts that I never rec'd a bill for or even a phone call from the hospital or facility. I have very good health insurance that paid over $14k when I had my baby... 3 months go by and I start getting notified by my credit monitoring agency that my credit score is going down. things such as a (pediatric audiology test $83) when my baby was 1 day old. apparently the audiologist doesnt bill through the hospital.... subsequently, they also dont bill the patients.. they outsource their billing to a 3rd party collection agency who immediately reports it to all 3 credit bureaus. Maybe i missed that forumn on this sight, A company can send a $100 bill to Transunion and say I owe it,  and BAM...my credit score takes a 10 point dive. Agencies should not be able to put something on your credit report without first having not only validated the debt and provided any and all documents that prove you owe the debt, but they must be required to have attempted to collect the debt. I have had businesses tell em that its cheaper to put the bill directly on your credit report than it is to hire a 3rd party to collect the debt. This is a horrible injustice to the people who pay their bills, maintain health iunsurance and who will pay their outstanding debts. The system is set up to force the consumer to prove their innocence (if you will) verus the creditor proving they are owed a debt.




jfearon

jfearon, I think you have to do it online. I was able to clean up a family member's credit report online.




josephusmyer

I agree with josephusmyer. Our son ran up small debts at several stores and banks around eight years ago. Debt-collectors (debt-buyers) have contacted him and threatened him with legal action on time-barred debts (without notifying him of the status).




laguish

It seems to me that the system must provide a series of 'handshakes': When a dispute is initiated; when the dispue is resolved; or when a dispute is withdrawn. In each case the consumer must know with certainty that the collector acknowledges the consumer's position and that the CRA has been properly notified. The CRA must be party to the handshake, It is unacceptable that consumer's complaints can laguish for months with the consumer having no way to determine whether the CRA has received updated information from the collector or whether the CRA is taking unduly long to process the update.

legidimate

If I am paying for the minutes on my phone, which I do, then I should be able to chose who's call I do and do not want to answer. When it comes up 'unknown", how do I know it's a Collection Agency, a telemarketer trying to sell me vacation homes, cruse lines trying to sell me a cruse, someone wanting to offer me a better mortgage rate, ect... Every call I answer deducts time from my minutes  and that is NOT fair to me. I now block ALL "unknown, withheld & private" calls. If they truly are legidimate and want to talk to me, press 1 to unblock, just like I have to.




liedand

I was flat out lied to by the attorney for a credit card company who brought a small claims suit against me. I disputed the debt (and still do even after they garnished my wagesbut they intimidated me into a payment arrangement then lied to me and said there was no court date anymore since I "settled".I was skeptical and called the clerk of court's office only to find out they liedand I did need to show up.I showed up for the court date, even as I argued that this court had no jurisdiction over me because I never lived in that countybut no-one even the clerk's office would listen to meand I was denied the right to go before a judge.I was only given an opportunity to talk to the attorney for the credit card company and sign papers saying we had a payment arrangement.Long story short, I made 1 of 2 payments then lost my job.I called them immediately to tell them I would make the 2nd and final payment 2-3 weeks late because I had to wait for a final check.They told me okay,but unbeknownst to me,they went back to court without me and got a default judgement for $1600 on what would have been a $709 payment.iI never got notice of the court hearing nor did I ever get a copy of the judgement.I didn't find out about it until I got a wage garnishment notice from my new employer 2 1/2 years later....VERY humiliating!My employer got the wage garnishment notice a week before I didso I couldn't even dispute it before my employer was involved.Second, I called the clerk of court's office in that county (3 hours from my home) and argued that you can't go to court without giving me a chance to defend myself and I shouldn't be forced to drive 3 hours each way to a county I never lived in.I was told by the clerk's office that they can file it wherever they want and I have to show up.I asked "So if they wanted to file this in California to be jerks you're telling me I'd have to get on a plane and fly to California to defend a $709 lawsuit""She said "Yes."THAT HAS TO CHANGE.




litgation

As a creditor collecting my own debt, I assert that by the time I move to litgation, I've exhausted all other forms of collection. I've talked to, emailed, and snail mailed the debtor. I've tried to negotiate a payment plan or settlement offer all to no avail. Litigation is our last attempt. Once we are litigation, we present our best case and let the debtor present their defense. My experience is that debtors don't participate in their defense out of either fear or lack of knowledge about the legal process. But the burden of educating the debtor shouldn't be put on the creditor's shoulders. If debtor's prefer to ignore the issue, then a default judgment is justified. There should be consequences to the inaction of the debtor.




majotiry

I assume by "free to end" you meant the agency is on the hook for the charges incurred on that particular call. I think it would be well worth exploring. We do have situations where the consumer doesnt have a landline and refuses access to their cell. If we recieve a cease and desist order we note the account and return it to our client as such.

mistargeted

I still vividly remember receiving automated calls every Saturday morning in college insisting that I settle a debt under someone else's name. It was a case of mistaken identity,  and eventually I sorted it out by tracking down the collection agency and calling them during business hours. This was a tremendous inconvenience, however. I strongly support limitations on robocalls, on total call volumes, and ask that you consider creating a complaint process for harassing or mistargeted calls. Collection agencies should face financial sanctions for misbehavior, payable to the target of their abuse.




or15

We have no debt other than what is current on our credit cards, but for 10 or15 years we have been receiving robo calls for an Edward Flanigan.We've owned this number for 22 years and have never known an Edward Flanigan.We are on the do not call list.Robo calls by debt collectors need to be banned outright.




paramound

security would be paramound. Since the weaknesses in current authentication practices financial institutions/others covered by FACTA and the FCRA are not within the scope of this legislation, it shouldn't be difficult to impose those same security standards on any centralized debt collection database.




partyMany

Assuming debtors have a valid address, which is some cases they do not, additional notice that the debt is being assigned to a third party collection entity is no benefit.My experience is intervention to collect by a third party normally occurs when the consumer is over 180 contractual delinquent.Furthermore, if the consumer receives the warning the account would be placed with a third partyMany and more confusing to the consumer and agency.




passify

Telephonic pretrial-hearings can be scheduled in support of a consumer having to work; times set and or scheduled with a court representative could passify this issue.




paythefiddler

paythefiddler, It's not just innocent family members that debt collectors go after, it's also perfect strangers. I have a common last name, no debts, and have been the target of many debt collectors. All of the deadbeats have had my common last name and first initial. Once a debt collector has me on their hit list, they don't stop calling until I sent them a cease-communication letter. They want me to pay the debt to get them to stop.

Legally, I don't believe that CFPB authority should stretch into this area since the federal laws do not include such a limitation.Notification to a consumer that a debt is beyond statute is problematicsince that date is not permanent.Partial payment on an account restarts the statute of limitations.I don't believe that a rule issued by the CFPB can help here.Education of consumers is the only pro-active method that I see as available here.However, this education should include notification to the legal profession that the CFPB will bring violations in this area to the attention of the Attorney General in their state.




puninshing

There should be a monetary "floor" required before debt collectors can pursue uncollected debts in court. The idea that corporations that already charge puninshing interest rates and fees can clog the court systems trying to collect a few hundred bucks from someone who is unemployed, ill, or otherwise unable to pay is counter-productive. There should be a minimum amount of consumer debt owed before creditors can sue debtors. Another issue with using state and local courts to settle debt collection suits is that it burdens jurisdictions already heavily burdened with cases and strapped for cash.




purchasors

banks can simply add this provision to their Loan Sale Agreements. All buyers executing a Loan Sale Agreement containing such a provision would be contractually obligated to refrain from litigating or threatening litigation. some current buyer would refuse to purchase with such a provision and other current buyers would expect a price discount because they woudl not be able to sue. In both instances, any inventory not acquired by current buyers would be quicly snapped up by other purchasors who would be willing to comply with these contractual provisions. Such a resolution would obviate the necessity of legislation or regulation as the matter woudl have been taken care of under the contract between a willing seller and a willing buyer. there would be no constitutional question regarding the restricting of law suits  nor would there be any delay in implementation. All that would be required is the cooperation of the selling banks which could be induced readily with some Safe-Harbor language for banks that follow this protocol.




querstions

No matter how you slice this conversation, phone calls are the biggest abuse. You can have rules and do about the time, but they are ignored. Until you or the FTC creates rules that fine these people -- and not put the burden on the consumer to sue -- this abuse will go on. I have to laugh at these querstions. You have to be putting me on. The most abusive things debt collectors do are with their phones. They block their numbers still. They use various numbers they mislead their identities. THE PROBLEM is the onus is on the hapless consumer to get legal redress. Not good enough. You need to create fines and actually impose them. That will stop this phone abuse. They call at work, always wkill have some excuse. and call after hours. Be honest, this is an outrage what these companies have done,  and nobody has minded the store on them. Never should the onus be on the consumer to get this to stop. You have to find a lawyer who thinks a whopping $1,000 is worth suing over. You have rigged this system in favor of the sharks., and that is why these sleazy companies have proliferated and have grown more and more egregious in their actions. no more recorded calls. call from one number as soon as someone says stop calling, STOP. if there is any call beyond that, they get fined. Agreed, people will have to write a letter  because none of these companies will admit they were told to stop calling. But they do receive the letters, which should go to a physical address and to a person, not just a vague company name. Last, stop allowing these bad companies to change their names. They get in trouble, they change their names, and go on doing terrible things under another name. Just look online at some of these companies and how many names they've gone through. The reason this got so bad is nobody has been looking out for the consumer.




recipeint

You are correct. There is quite a difference between send and receive. All I am suggesting is that a creditor only be required to send any notice to the last known address - not that the consumer receive it. and you presume too much if you think that all mail is returned if not delivered to the proper recipeint), then the creditor must send the notice to that new address. If the point of this dialogue is to ensure the consumer is protected, then require the consumer to protect themselves and provide this information to the creditor. If they don't then a creditor can't be hanged in a lawsuit for a letter failing to reach a consumer, when the creditor actions used the best information on hand.




repying

I am concerned about the perception consumers have concerning older debts. With the knowledge that this legislation is both to improve debt collection practices (helping the credit industry) and to educate and protect consumers (to increase confidence and enforce their rights), this is especially relevent. Many consumers appear to be under the impression, if they haven't managed to pay off the debt within the first initial years, they should *ignore* it until it falls off their credit report. Reviving the debt is the issue. Yet these consumers are not concerned about paying the debt off in full they might be in much better financial standing now. They're concerned about how paying a debt affects their credit score. I believe this should be concerning. If a debt is outstanding, and repying part (or all) of this debt actually would *worsen* a consumer's credit, it seems counter-intuitive. It works both against the interests of creditors and debt collectors - and the interest of consumers who owe money on a debt. I don't know of a viable solution, but I'm certain this is a concern which should be addressed.




robodial

During the past 2 years I have been repeatedly contacted by a variety of collection agencies. It began innocently enough, when one of them called me, asking "when can we expect your payment," when that statement had not yet arrived and was not due until the 20th of the month and the call occurred on the 11th. It was a collection agency hired by Capital One. Coincidentally, I purchased various items at Costco a few days later and received the shock of my little life when my credit card was denied. I called Capital One from a phone at Costco and was told I had not made my payment... this was even stranger because I pay off my balance each month. What I didn't know is that Costco switched from a very nice bank (HSBC) to Capital One, never notified me  and Capital One immediately played hardball, albeit unnecessarily. To answer their strong-arm tactics, I wrote a letter to Robert Crawford, the incoming CFO of Capital One, in which I had cut up both credit cards and told him to "shove it," for treating a long-time customer like something you scrape off the shoe! When the collection calls began, I was in a great mood after all, I had initiated this mess. However, they were unfaird from the beginning. They use I.V.R. numbers. Without technical jargon, it means that the number we see on caller i.d. is never the number from which they're calling,  so you can't block their call my provider allows me to block 12 numbers  and I wondered how these collection agencies were constantly squeaking by). They robodial,  so you can and do get several calls per day and before 8:00 AM and after 9:00 PM, since they know there is very little you can do about the early or late calls, besides whine That said, what followed was even worse.... the collection agency (Portfolio Recovery) which was able to place a bogus $9,924 "collection" on my Experian credit score, which I saw because Target offered me 1-year free credit monitoring, which, by the way, isn't free if you want to see your complete profile... they have no paperwork to substantiate this charge  and it has completely ruined my credit, pulling down my FICO from 795 - 810 to 610! To me, having collection agency CEO's boiled in oil seems like an act of mercy!




stanadrized

This Draft Summary of Discussion fails to address the issues of confusion about the statute of limitations and how they vary among states. This is a big source of confusion in terms of collection of a debt and jurisdiction. Creating a more stanadrized set of rules would alleviate these problems. In 2010, the FTC released a report, "Repairing A Broken System," which made mention of the need a universal statute of limitations. Additionally, in 2011 ACA's plan, "The Path Forward: ACA International"s Blueprint for Modernizing America"s Consumer Debt Collection System" also advocated for a national statute of limitations. This is something that both sides of the industry actually agree upon. 50 different states and 50 different statutes make it too confusing for consumers. I also reiterate that a compromise in terms of years can be reached. Also, debt tolling needs to be done away with. It only adds to the confusion of when a debt becomes time-barred. We live in a transient society. A debt should not legally follow a person for the rest of their life: Repairing A Broken System - Federal Trade Commission: __URL__ InsideArm: Statutes of Limitations Frustrate Debt Collectors and Consumers __URL__ The Path Forward: ACA International"s Blueprint for Modernizing America"s Consumer Debt Collection System: __URL__




subservice

Debt Collection companies get a very unfair debt negotiation advantage against an alleged defaulter when they hire an unscrupulous service company that has lied about giving a proper service or subservice to the alleged debtor's residence. Judges do not seem to understand that if a service company will fraudulently state in court documents that they served a defaulter or subserved someone at the residence when in fact they did not, that the debt collector can become very arrogant and cocky as to how they negotiate with the alleged defaulter. In a nutshell, if the debt collector's one sided terms are not met, they will simply hire the service company who will provide service even if it is a false service. Judges rationalize that the mail service is an adequate notification without realizing that what a false service does is embolden the debt collection company to not properly negotiate a debt with an alleged defaulter because they have total control over the service aspect, even if fraudulently obtained. This need to be fixed and false servers need to be fined along with the debt collection companies who hire them and keep hiring them even after they receive complaints of false service.

Larry S, your quote..."A plaintiff in a lawsuit cannot be placed in a situation where it is rewarding to sue with insufficient cause and minimal risk" is a very powerful statement and one that I entirely agree with. It is this scenario that emboldens debt collectors to hire riff raff service companies who will lie about doing a legal service or sub service, and apparently get away with it. I have been victimized by two false subservices. I think both were done by the same service company.

I found an unsealed envelope in my mail box that had court documents in them. I contacted the debt collection company and asked what was going on  since I had not been served. They claimed a subservice had already been done to someone at my residence. I explained that was probably not likely  because I am a Caregiver and I would have been the only one to answer the door and I did not get any service. I had to pay to file a response and was late by one day, andthen had to challenge the default because of the non service. The judge agreed that there had been no valid subservice  based on the fact that the service company used the most generic "guess" they could come up with, a women in her mid 30's to late 40's, around 5 foot 4 inches, weight around 130 pounds to 150 pounds. That is about as generic of a description as one could give,  and it was completely wrong. because that person did not exist. They even made up a name of someone I had never heard of and when I googled the name, could not find it anywhere on the internet. The second time a false subservice happened, a very similar description was given as the first time,  and the alleged subservice recipient was identified as "Jane Doe". I would like to point how dangerous these lies are on another level. I exclusively have been providing CareGiving services for my parents, no one else has. By lying and introducing these lies into a court document, anytime in the future I could be accused of exposing my parents to a person at our residence who never even existed. I was also somewhat frozen by this level of dishonesty because on the rare occasion when I had to sue someone, I followed the law and had the service performed legally and properly. I just expected the same in return and by not getting it weakens one's ability to respond.

superseed

If federal rules can be ignored by local/municipal/state laws then the federal laws are irrelevant. Consumer credit is recognized in all 50 states and internationally. As such these laws should be enforced by each state and lower courts and states and such should not be able to make laws that ignore of superseed federal law.




taxguy

Consumers who ask for validation should receive just that: a validation that the agency has verified the balance due has some basis as alleged. Too often consumers categorize this process as requiring "proof" as taxguy does. This is not the function of the validation process. "Proof" is something that will occur in court (or not). No document will be enough "proof" for many consumers. That is why the court system exists.




teethless

While not specifically addressed in this website, the current punishment for violations of the FDCPA are practically teethless. 100 is of little consequence to most companies. The law show be changed to all ow a 7 year statute of limitations (it is currently one year) and a maximum penalty, payable to the plaintiff, of either $10,000 or $100,000 for each violation.




topwithspoofedcallerID

The problem is not with a form letter of dispute. The problem is that these websites and unreasonable letters lead unsophisticated debtors to believe that a creditor has to provide extraordinary proof that simply is not required. 'stopwithspoofedcallerID' (if that IS your real name) is correct that no legitimate dispute should be ignored, regardless of the form, but nor should debtors be allowed to abuse the system by repeatedly asking for proofs that are not required.




ultimatel

To start e-oscar should take internet complaints the same a shad written letters. They do not do that. They take internet disputes differently then they do hand written letter. That is in regards to disputed debts and it is important that the credit bureaus be consistent about the dispute process and the statues of limitations based on state laws. They should also have limits on how many collection agencies they sell the account of too including their shady practice of selling accounts of to collection agencies in different states. Their should be a cap on debts owed and the power that the agencies have on consumers. I think ultimatel it is about the collection agencies not abusing the consumer and helping consumers find ways to keep their accounts out default. A good start to offer consumers to get their accounts out of default would be based on charging consumers a small percentage of % coupled with a promissory note with a date to begin making payments to the debt collector. They abuse the consumers  and they should stop it. Overall, the communication process between consumers and debt collectors is flawed with mis communications and a lack of options to pay back what they owe.

I agree that of course an ideal situation would be for consumers not to pay. But let's not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. I was proposing some viable method that would result in an ability of a consumer to have a hearing. Hearings cost money and ultimately the collector would be assessed.




unfaird

It began innocently enough, when one of them called me, asking "when can we expect your payment," when that statement had not yet arrived and was not due until the 20th of the month and the call occurred on the 11th.

uninvolvement

Debt collectors file a large number of default judgments because quite simply consumers do not take action, not because they are unaware of the issue.Usually at the time a lawsuit is filed, a debt collector has attempted to resolve the issue via telephone calls and/or letters.This doesn't even include the efforts the original creditor may have made.A lawsuit is never a first response.It is usually done after numerous and repeated failed efforts to work with a consumer to resolve an outstanding debt.A default judgment is just a further extension of that.Even after we file suit, we may attempt to reach the consumer to resolve the lawsuit prior to judgment being taken.I have seen numerous files where we have spoken to the consumer and told them they can file an answer, and they still don't.In my opinion, default judgments are largely the result of consumer's deliberate uninvolvement with the process, rather than a collector taking deceptive steps.I will state that many states have local rules that if there is no response to a summons and the consumer has defaulted, they do not need to be noticed on a motion for a default judgment.Therefore, the actual entry of the judgment may in fact come as a surprise, despite the summons stating if you don't answer a judgment may be taken.However, an attorney who follows the local rules is not acting deceptively.In order to curb this shock for the consumer who doesn't answer, it wouldn't be bad to require all motions for judgment be served upon the consumer, despite local rules which may require otherwise.I would point out, many default judgment motions are not noticed for motion hour.They may simply be submitted for a ruling without a court hearing.As to the inquiry as to what is required to support a default judgment, this varies court to court and judge to judge.The courts that I have seen require more documentation are largely looking for affidavits of debt, charge off statements and statement showing payments or charges, and the assignment (if the plaintiff is a debt buyer).




wagesbut

I was flat out lied to by the attorney for a credit card company who brought a small claims suit against me. I disputed the debt (and still do even after they garnished my wagesbut they intimidated me into a payment arrangement then lied to me and said there was no court date anymore since I "settled".I was skeptical and called the clerk of court's office only to find out they liedand I did need to show up.I showed up for the court date, even as I argued that this court had no jurisdiction over me because I never lived in that countybut no-one even the clerk's office would listen to meand I was denied the right to go before a judge.I was only given an opportunity to talk to the attorney for the credit card company and sign papers saying we had a payment arrangement.Long story short, I made 1 of 2 payments then lost my job.I called them immediately to tell them I would make the 2nd and final payment 2-3 weeks late because I had to wait for a final check.They told me okay,but unbeknownst to me,they went back to court without me and got a default judgement for $1600 on what would have been a $709 payment.iI never got notice of the court hearing nor did I ever get a copy of the judgement.I didn't find out about it until I got a wage garnishment notice from my new employer 2 1/2 years later....VERY humiliating!My employer got the wage garnishment notice a week before I didso I couldn't even dispute it before my employer was involved.Second, I called the clerk of court's office in that county (3 hours from my home) and argued that you can't go to court without giving me a chance to defend myself and I shouldn't be forced to drive 3 hours each way to a county I never lived in.I was told by the clerk's office that they can file it wherever they want and I have to show up.I asked "So if they wanted to file this in California to be jerks you're telling me I'd have to get on a plane and fly to California to defend a $709 lawsuit""She said "Yes."THAT HAS TO CHANGE.




wanrings

I agree that this is about Financial Literacy, However, this is also about the court's enforcing completely one sided credit card adhesion agreements that don't give the debtor/defaulter, rights of any kind, even in the most humanitarian of situations, thereby calling into question the legality of these one sided credit card adhesion agreements. Lets not forget that it was the comptroller of the currency back in 2002 that prevented the Insurance industry from competing in the credit card debt suspension insurance arena with the credit card companies. This allowed the credit card companies to then have an obscene monopoly on overpriced credit card debt suspension insurance premiums they charged their own customers who otherwise could have carried insurance policies that would have frozen interest rate charges for a certain period of time when a life changing emergency occurred. Financial literacy is in play when it comes to the 2% monthly minimum payment addiction scam perpetrated on first time credit card borrowers. 2% monthly minimum payments are literally no different than a crack dealer giving out a few free hits of crack to get people hooked on their product. A person can be buy a $1,000 top of the line television set and only have a 20 or 25 dollar payment due the next month. That's credit card crack in my opinion. Financial Literacy could be a warning printed in bold letters on every credit card agreement warning how credit cards purposely have low monthly minimum payments to lure one into more and more debt, how credit card companies have no compassion for life changing events, and that credit card companies are overcharging for credit card debt suspension insurance by a factor of up to 2,000%. Put those three warnings on every agreement in bold letters,  and two things happen, customers have a better chance of becoming financially literate,  and it also is an admission of fraud by the credit card companies for all the prior agreements already in place. So the irony is the credit card companies can't change even if they wanted to. But where is the outside force to come from to make the obvious happen in regards to those three credit card wanrings? Apparently it can't come from the CFPB,  which is unfortunate  because it turn this ties the courts hands that much more.
